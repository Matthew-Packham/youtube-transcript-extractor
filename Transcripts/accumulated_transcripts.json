    "Title": "The Psychology of Male Loneliness",
    "Transcript": "There are of course exceptions, buddies who know all about intimacy and cosiness, camaraderie and connection. But let's state the darker and more general truth plainly: friendship is difficult for men. For every man who can claim a decent male friend, there must be at least eight who - in the honesty of their deep minds - know they have none that truly merit the term. The problem - though it strikes at an individual level - is anchored in larger societal forces. Men are lonely not through any specific deficiency on their part but because of an inherent conflict between what is required of being a man on the one hand and what is involved in being a friend on the other. The bedrock of true friendship is - unfortunately - mutual vulnerability. We may, naturally, foster a friendship by discussing how many goals Manchester United scored in the year of the last World Cup or how hypersonic aeroplane engines work or the average return of an S&P 500 stock. There can be a certain interest in thinking together about the classical influence within Picasso's late period, or the idea of justice in Platos' The Laws or the influence of Plotinus on early Renaissance thought. But genuine friendship, the sort that nourishes and sustains, that argues against despair and helps with the eeriness of the early hours, has to begin somewhere else. It starts the moment that one person says to another: 'I'm going out of mind'; 'I hate my partner's guts'; 'I'm terrified'. Or: 'Help me'. It starts when a man can admit: 'I'm in love with a colleague'; 'I can't get it up any more'. Or: 'the anxiety never stops'. There won't be a friendship that properly counts until we can reveal ourselves to be as weak as we are, until we can confess that we have been lying to preserve face and that the truth is far ghastlier and sadder, far more tender and more bathetic than we've yet been able to let on. Regrettably for men, since the earliest days, across civilisations, it has been self-evident that to be a man involves something else entirely: being unflinching and solid, unperturbed and straightforward, buoyant and resourceful. It's about not minding that we've been left or sacked, humiliated or bullied. It's about never losing an erection and knowing how to rule an empire without taking to bed and pining for mother. It's ultimately about never, ever being that most dreaded and abhorrent of things: a crybaby. The best way to break the loneliness must be to admit with humour and grace that it exists and that one may be more than fed up that it does so. Of course men often don't know how to be close. Of course they might be substantially friendless. It should be no surprise if they've never had an honest conversation with another member of their gender. Little in their histories allows for such an eventuality. If we were tempted to make a practical change, we might design some packs of conversation cards and give them out to men take with them to the bar and the pub, the shooting range and the golf club. On them would be printed a range of questions of a kind that men might long to ask one another and seldom can: - When did you last cry? - What would you want to tell me if you knew I wouldn't judge you? - When do you feel most anxious? - What makes you despair? - What do you want to be forgiven for? - What does the small boy inside you feel? Most would agree that such cards were - naturally - idiotic and unnecessary. But how useful they might be if they provided even a small opportunity for a few men to let down their guard and reveal a more complex reality. The histories of art and literature are all the proof one might require that men are capable of the greatest empathy and tenderness. The tragedy is that men are so seldom able to direct these emotions towards one another, that they must spend their lives barricaded in themselves, in dread of becoming, in the eyes of their fellow men, a child or a woman, that they must waste so much time and be so brave in defending an illusion that they never asked to be a part of."

    "Title": "The 9 Most Common Mistakes We Make when Choosing a Partner",
    "Transcript": "The 9 Most Common Mistakes We Make when Choosing a Partner Choosing a long-term partner may be the single most consequential decision any of us ever has to make. No wonder we can get a little scared on dates. If we get the choice right, we may enjoy supportiveness, cosiness and intimacy for the rest of our lives; if we get it wrong, our confidence, health, financial wherewithal and sanity will be on the line. England's greatest novelist, Jane Austen, spent her career writing almost exclusively about her characters' quests to locate a suitable mate. As critics have pointed out, in the world outside her study, Britain was fighting a war of survival against Napoleonic France, but Austen never saw fit to mention the conflict even once, so busy was she telling us about who blushed on seeing whom at which party. One might smirk, but her priorities may have been correct. War is indeed a very serious matter; choosing a partner is a properly monumental one. What then are some of the most weighty mistakes we make when attempting to find a lover? Our Terror of Loneliness Much of the reason for our unhappy romantic lives comes down to our dread of the single state. So terrified are we of our own company and of the persistent humiliations of the dating rigmarole, we become fatefully generous towards mediocre partners who may - over time - end up making us feel far lonelier and more miserable than if we were merely on our own. The single greatest guarantor of contented love is a capacity to endure one's own company. The Sunk Cost Fallacy We stay because we have already been here for so long: because it's already far too late, given that we're 21, or 39 or 104. We think relentlessly of the 3 months, five years or two decades that we've already spent with a person, with all the hope implied - and thereby overlook that a short happy future is always worth more than a lengthy fractious past. We forget too that though people may occasionally change, they seem never to do so when one politely asks them to. Muddled Assumptions of Better Alternatives Of course they're a bit awful, the question is whether one is dealing with an especially obtuse sort or just another member of our collectively maddening species. We're always choosing from a pool, and we need - to a maximal extent - to know what other kinds of creatures swim in it. Our level of calm years from now is going to depend on having built up - through experience - a fair and robust sense of what an acceptable degree of frustration might be. Anyone can find someone annoying; the true skill is to have determined the relative inevitability of their vexatiousness, to know how to distinguish hysterical misery from normal unavoidable unhappiness. A Hatred of Love We may spend a great many years pushing away anyone with the gall to try to love us. Our repulsion tends to have its roots in difficult childhoods in which we built up an association between intimacy on the one hand and pain on the other; between closeness and suffering. We now suspect that anyone who is sweet must be deluded for identifying in us a lovability that we don't recognise in ourselves. Happy love may be what we crave; it isn't necessarily what we can remotely tolerate. The Appeal of Madness It can take a long time to develop immunity to the appeal of those who blow hot and cold, hate themselves, refuse our affection, deceive us and fall into rages and despair late at night. We may be deep into middle age before we cotton onto the extraordinary merits and subtle exoticism of sane reliable 'boring' people, who trust others, go to therapy, garden, like themselves and love their parents. The Tragedies of Defensiveness It's the character trait that single handedly dooms more relationships than any other - and means that when one gently raises a complaint against a partner, they reply that this isn't a good time, that it's one's own fault, that there is in fact no problem, that one is being mean and that this is all too much. It's a blessed day when one lands on a human who, thanks to the love of early caregivers, utters the magical words: 'How interesting, I hear you… You might have a point… Let me have a think about what you're saying…' Underestimating the cumulative impact of character flaws We tell ourselves that it's only a little thing, just a small tendency in them to do x or y or z. Then again, a pebble is also only a very small thing but if we have one in our shoe and we are running a marathon, after a mile our foot will be soaked in blood. Underestimating Physical Attraction It's a criterion that clever people (like us) are especially prone to neglecting. Surely sexual appeal shouldn't detain us for too long when choosing a mate? Surely there are more important things to think at length about than who might be submissive and who dominant? But this is to overlook how many arguments are at heart about a resentment over absent sex and conversely how much one can forgive a mate after a satisfying twenty minutes together. Given that sex is (unlike good conversation or advice) typically the only thing that we're not legitimately allowed to seek outside a couple, we should make sure that the kind we are having in it is uncommonly satisfying. Perfectionism Our chances of making a good enough choice increase the more we recognise the impossibility of making a perfect one. Our marriages improve as we concede that we will - naturally - inevitably marry slightly the wrong person - but only because there is no such thing as the fully 'right' sort. Gods can marry paragons; we are fated to have to cope with just another demented sweet silly fool much like us. The most contented marriages rest on a bed of consoling, forgiving, gentle laughter-filled pessimism."

    "Title": "Why You Shouldn't Second Guess Your Decisions",
    "Transcript": "The business of living can be complicated by a particularly exhausting habit: our tendency to question our judgements with the passage of time. What had originally seemed like a clear cut and soundly-based decision can - after a few weeks or months - come under fresh scrutiny, and inspire intense doubt, regret, shame, insomnia and at points, hurried attempts to reverse a decision. For example, a few months ago, it seemed absolutely right to end our relationship. We had the partner's faults clearly in view and we were certain that these made any sensible plans for the future untenable. But now we're no longer so sure. We've been on a few dates and they didn't go too well. We've been by ourselves a lot and as we've been doing the laundry or walking around the park, we've started to remember how funny and clever, sweet and tender our ex could be. We're wondering whether we should, despite our original recommendation that neither of us should be in touch for a while, perhaps send them a falsely innocent text tonight. Or, last summer, we knew we didn't have a particularly good time at the beach side resort and vowed to stick to a cooler climate next time. But since then the weather has turned very cold and just recently, we're finding ourselves curious about returning south next year. Or we told ourselves that we were fully done with a particular career. But we've been reflecting on matters since and happened to bump into an old colleague last week - and are now wondering whether we shouldn't maybe make another attempt. Or a friend from university has suggested a meal. We found them rather self-centred and dull when we last saw them a decade ago, but they sounded sparky in their invitation and we've agreed to meet them for lunch near the station next week. In such instances, it can be useful to keep a broad principle in mind. The further away we stand from the moment when we took a decision, the more our judgement is likely to be clouded and corrupted. And this is because of a feature of our minds that - in most areas - serves us extremely well: our capacity to let go of pain. The very faculty that means we can effectively mourn the death of a pet or a loved one or get over a bankruptcy or endure a drop in income also means that we are likely to revise our views of an ex we worked very sensibly to eject from our lives or that will know within five minutes of remeeting an acquaintance that they are as maddening as they ever were. We pick apart and dissolve our judgements because we cannot keep a clear eye on the powerful incentives we come under to do so; because we don't notice how indigestible certain truths have become. We abdicate to doubt under intolerable, irrepressible degrees of loneliness and sadness, isolation and confusion. Of course we're going to start to question our views of our ex's strengths and weaknesses after seven weekends substantially on our own being humiliated on dating apps. Of course we won't remember our friend's dispiriting character when we would so love to have a flourishing social life. When we wake up and wonder if we have been unfair or hasty, the sternest, most reasonable part of us should know to grab the controls and ask whether a revision to our views is likely to be accurate or simply convenient. Despite all the pressures we are under to believe otherwise, we should place our faith in the wisdom of a well-worn dictum: trust what you knew then, not what you feel now."

    "Title": "How Successful People Take Risks",
    "Transcript": "We are - most of us - likely at some point in childhood to have been told the story of Daedalus and Icarus. This Ancient Greek myth - which dates back to the earliest days of civilisation - introduces us to the gifted and canny architect Daedalus, who was imprisoned by evil king Minos in a tall tower in an isolated corner of Crete, together with his beloved son Icarus. Unwilling to spend the rest of his days in captivity, Daedalus constructed some wings by glueing together the feathers of passing birds with beeswax and invited Icarus to join him on the window ledge in a bid for freedom. But with one caveat: if Icarus ever went too high, the sun's rays would turn the wax into liquid and Icarus would be done for. After successfully negotiating a way through Cretan airspace, somewhere past Samos, despite his father's kindly and patient warnings, Icarus got carried away; the young man couldn't keep a handle on his joy, his wings fell apart and he plunged into the sea just off the coast of a picturesque small island that honours his memory to this day, Ikaria. The way we are typically told the story, the moral is weighted firmly in one direction: don't get over-exuberant, keep a reign on your impulses, make sure you don't get big headed, don't show off, calm yourself. The myth would not have entered the folklore of our species if this were not supremely sensible advice. Clearly no good life is possible without a sharp awareness of the perils of egomania and untempered raw appetite. But the very solidity of the message is at risk of blinding us to a crucial subsidiary idea lurking covertly within the narrative. This is not just a tale of pride and arrogance, not just a tale of getting too big for one's boots and of neglecting one's true position. It's also a story of hope, of necessary escape, of giving something a chance, of not remaining locked up forever at the whims of foolish authorities; of daring to plot an alternative. For every one person who jumps out of towers without sufficient self-control, there are - we should note - others, perhaps many others, who - just as tragically - stay in towers their whole lives long, not just in one room, but at the edge of a box within a cupboard under a bed, too frightened ever to accede to their own potency and freedom, too timid ever dare to evade unfair restrictions, too cowed to bring themselves to imagine a better future. There are - when we look at the matter squarely - in fact two morals in this central Ancient Greek myth: the traditional one about the trouble of flying too close to the sun, and also, more quietly, the lesser-known one about the terrible risks of remaining a prisoner all one's life. There is a figure in this story to whom we should look for clues as to how we might handle the painful dichotomy at play. It is Daedalus who, despite what eventually transpired, should be recognised as having tried with particular dexterity to model for his son what a successful life could be like. He didn't just warn Icarus of boundless dangers; he didn't just go on about how bold schemes never work out and how timidity is mandatory. He expressly didn't want his son to spend the rest of his days in confinement. He didn't think it was a great idea to give the ultimate victory to tyrants. He spoke to him of the possibilities of trying on wings, he wanted his child to head out on the prevailing currents and have a shot at reaching new lands. We should not inevitably deploy examples of ghastly accidents to impede our appetite for novelty and satisfaction. We have clever minds with which to plot sound escape routes, we can be ingenious in the face of our enemies. We must - of course - take sensible precautions. We must - of course - at points be quiet. There are - of course - requirements for strategy and forbearance. But if we only ever think of safety, if all we are obsessed by are the crashes, then we are fated to die in despair in any case. There must and can be a good midway point between succumbing in a prison and drowning out at sea. What typically shapes our underlying attitudes is, as it were, who Daedalus was for us. There are fathers and mothers who talk to us gently and imaginatively about risks and returns; they discuss the downsides of over-excitement but also of those of meekness. And then there are others who cannot countenance their children ever taking to the skies - perhaps because they still haven't worked a way out of prison for themselves. We know a lot, maybe too much, about the catastrophes that can follow from ambition. We shouldn't allow ourselves to forget that, whatever the fate of poor Icarus, there are always equally potent risks bound up with never pushing ourselves a little closer to our sun's vital and warming rays."

    "Title": "Why We Can't Stop Loving Those Who Hurt Us",
    "Transcript": "Some of us appear to have an above average talent for finding ourselves in unfulfilling relationships. Our unions might begin with a lot of hope - but in time, problems set in: a lack of affection, an absence of intimacy, an emotional chill, affairs. When these issues rear their heads, most of us would know to think that - however lovely the start might have been - it is time to leave. And fairly fast. Someone who has messed us around as the partner has, or been as cold, or as sadistic, does not deserve a second or indeed any chance. But for others of us, this is when we begin to show our distinctive colours. Hope springs eternal. Yes, the partner may presently be somewhat disappointing but soon they may recover. Admittedly, they have become hugely unkind in many ways, but they apologised nicely last week (before repeating their offence) and so there is a decent chance - we believe - that things will be on an upswing over the longer term. To outside observers, the faith that we have in our partner can appear quasi religious. Why do we keep giving our unreliable companion so much leeway? Why do we hope against hope? Why don't we cut our losses right now and leave? Why are we so convinced that with just a little more effort on our part, one more discussion, one more long email sent in the early hours, everything will alter? Furthermore, perhaps, why do we keep assuming that we have done something wrong and that it is primarily our role to apologise and make amends? The explanation is that we grew into hopeful people not by choice but of necessity. We almost certainly spent our childhoods in circumstances where we had no option but to become enormous believers in our parents - and, simultaneously, enormous doubters of ourselves. When little, we could not afford to think that our parents were simply disappointing wounded people with whom we should not interact too much - and walk away. We were four years old. So we did what children of unfulfilling parents always do. We started to think ill of ourselves, we developed a genius for wondering what was wrong with us and for assembling complicated and overly generous explanations for the bad behaviour of others. We evolved an expectant stance towards whatever morsel of love our parent might throw our way; we became excited by deprivation. All day they might have been ill-tempered and cruel to us; perhaps at night fall, they might say something sweet and ruffle our hair. This became the most exciting (and appalling) 'game' of our lives. As adults, we continue to be addicted to this tension. It has come to seem that this is what love is: the pain-tinged continuous expectation that an unfulfilling person might abruptly turn around and be nice to us again. Love is waiting for someone who was once slightly kind to resume their interest. It doesn't strike us that love might actually be something quite different, simpler and less tortured: an ongoing reliable exchange of mutually respectful sympathy and gentleness. And if is not this, that we should leave at once. Indeed, if we have the troubled fortune to meet a reliable soul, we will probably respond to them with a feeling of nausea and bewilderment - and flee in short order (perhaps back to the last unfulling partner). The toll we pay in terms of wasted years is lamentable. Whereas others among us can enjoy calm, kindly relationships, we will get locked into exhausting scenarios with perturbed individuals who very subtly mess us around, who say one thing and do another, who don't give us physical affection or blow hot and cold, who may be having affairs and keep promising to change and don't. And the worst is that, for all our suffering, this somehow excites us, this keeps us on our toes, this feels like what we need to keep doing. We know nothing else. We have to start to believe what our childhoods never allowed us to think: some people need to be given up on, certain seemingly ordinary and good people are in fact very damaged and will hurt and bully those around them. Some people with a few lovely qualities to them will, considered in the round, work an entirely negative effect on our lives. It's not our role to keep second guessing unfulfilling people; to spin elaborate stories as to why they may be doing what they do. We don't need to think more about their psychology than they care to. We need to look very closely at what they do, not why they might be as they are. And conversely, despite our nausea, we don't need to keep holding it against certain others that they are kind. There is nothing wrong with them for being sweet, there is something very sad about our past that we are so easily sickened by their manner. If this sounds like us, we urgently need to tell ourselves that the person who has maltreated or is maltreating us will never change. Our boundless hope that they might is not rooted in any reality, it's the legacy of a childhood which obliged us to keep faith with people who no free person should ever have had to keep faith with. There is one and only one criterion that determines whether we should be with someone: whether or not they are kind to us. If they were but are no longer, we need to leave. If they are only a small percentage of the time, we need to leave. If they show a promise of kindness, but no delivery, we need to leave. We need to break our addiction to a suffering that we were not owed then - and definitely don't deserve now."

    "Transcript": "We might expect that, if we could eavesdrop on the conversations of the most admirable, clever and loving couples in the world, those who had properly cracked the puzzles of intimacy and emotional maturity, we would hear them talking in the noblest ways about the most serious things. On any given evening, they might be found discussing the connections between attachment theory and their early bonds with their parents, they might read a paper together by Melanie Klein or they might relax by watching an early film by Akira Kurosawa (Rashomon or Sanshiro Sugata). So it may come as a surprise that in all likelihood, these couples would do nothing of the sort. Through our recording equipment, we might hear some of the following: one of them starting to wonder why bananas grow in an oblong curved shape, the other - not quite listening - going off on a tangent about an ulcer they've got on the left side of their tongue while filing a toenail and half glancing at an airline review video on YouTube, which might be followed by the other speculating (for no apparent reason, in a bad imitation of a German accent) on the lyrics in an album by Dire Straits, which might be a prelude to their partner suggesting that they wanted to follow up on last night's reheated curry with a chocolate biscuit dipped in strawberry yoghurt. It might sound like regressive nonsense and in key ways it is, but we might want to maintain that this sort of incoherent chatter should also be considered one of the high-water marks of emotional intimacy and in its way, a bellwether of the most serious kinds of interpersonal closeness. People who know each other extremely well and love one another deeply, do not - it appears - sit together discussing philosophy or the accelerator theory in economics, they shoot the breeze, they swerve here and there, they talk shit and this, far from being some kind of distraction or unfortunate lapse, is a strange and profound proof of the depths of their mutual affection. Intimacy is about daring to be increasingly and bravely weird with someone else - and finding out that that's OK with them. In the recesses of all of our minds flows a stream of consciousness that mixes the serious and the unserious, the consequential and the flighty, the physical and the emotional. And when we have allowed ourselves to be genuinely close to someone, it is to this that we take them; we do them the honour of showing them who we actually are, not who we should or pretend to be - a privilege we grant only to a handful of people in our lives. Everyone else may know our sensible selves; they've been introduced to, and know how to love and take an interest in a naughty sweet curious and highly peculiar babbling child. When we talk about nothing in particular we're doing something even more significant than when we attempt to say rational and logical things: we are allowing someone into the primordial parts of ourselves that the rules of society otherwise censor. We are doing one of the most courageous and important things in the world: allowing someone else to know us."

    "Transcript": "For some of us, happiness and excitement never seem to last for very long. Every time we finally take pride in ourselves and develop a confidence about the future, something adverse seems to happen within a relatively short order. It might be something that we find ourselves actively doing that collapses our spirits, or we start to worry acutely about a matter that suddenly enters our minds or an incident occurs from out of the blue that unsettles us. Maybe we read something online that seems mean-minded and worrying. Or we catch sight of ourselves in the mirror and feel repulsed. Or we suddenly think of something we said or did seven and a half years ago that may have been misinterpreted and misconstrued - and start to panic. Or by some odd impulse that we don't really understand and so can't resist, we do something foolish and contrary to our normal values which brings on guilt and shame. And as a result, we are 'brought back down to earth' fairly sharply. We end up - only hours or days after the good mood began - in a familiar place of fear, anxiety and disappointment. It can be as if - without quite realising it - we are operating under some sort of secret law: thou shalt never be exuberant. Thou shalt never live life too much to the full. Thou shalt never be too happy. Thou shalt not believe in yourself. Thou shalt worry a lot. Where might such a perverse and sad edict have come from? It may be the result of growing up in an environment where our flourishing was somehow deemed unwelcome and provocative. Had we ever been too conspicuously happy, we might have upset a parent who was battling a sense of despair or resignation and was furious at the deprivations they once had to endure. And who could not count countenance that a child of theirs might be any more content than they were. We may have grown up to associate a low fearful mood with safety. Sadness means you don't get attacked, it doesn't provoke envy. It keeps you out of trouble. Whenever happiness does seem on the cards, a part of us will hence be very keen to return us to a lower altitude as soon as possible. To achieve our ends, there may be some favourite websites we like to go to that confirm that we are unattractive, or strange or in danger. We may provoke arguments, insults or offence. We've got a repertoire of secret skills to wipe the smile off our faces. Were any of this to ring bells, we should ask ourselves: what incentives against happiness and self-satisfaction might there have been in our early lives? Who might we have upset with our joy? Was there a conflict between our flourishing and someone else's sense of well-being? Then we need to reassure the frightened child in us that the person who demanded our sadness as a price for their protection is no longer in authority over us. We don't have to apologise for being attractive or intelligent or gifted or within reach of stability, sanity, potency and good spirits. We are - whatever we once believed - allowed to live without continuous sadness and fear."

    "Transcript": "We would - of course - want to get rid of this thing forever and heaven knows we will have tried. We'll have gone on courses, read books, hired psychiatrists and psychotherapists, taken medicines. And through this, we would have veered between despair and hope that we might eventually be able to achieve a victory over our monsters. But the more time passes, the more we have to take on board a bleaker, unavoidable reality: this thing is here for the long term. In the one life we'll ever have, this is us. We'll never be rid of the bugs. We have a chronic condition, not an illness. How can we survive this ostensibly extremely dispiriting realisation? A range of thoughts come to mind. - A certain mindset First and foremost, we need a certain mindset, one combining intense doses of pessimism with bleak humour and the most tender compassion. We never asked for this, we didn't do anything especially wrong, it's not a sign of a sinful nature. We can speculate at length about where it comes from: an emotional inheritance, a biological condition, the outcome of certain choices we've made… It will be a distinctive mixture of all these and, in the grander scheme, it may not really matter. The task is ultimately just to accept that this is the fight of our lives. - Celebrate Small Wins Against a bleak picture, we need to redraw our horizons and expectations. We're never going to solve the whole problem, therefore we need to be able to particularly celebrate when things aren't especially awful; when we have a good day or two. We know - by now - that the problems are always going to return, which is why we have no option but to draw maximal satisfaction when, every now and then, we go through a steady and coherent passage. We need to become the sort of people who can say, without irony or bitterness, Wednesday went well and that's a serious accomplishment. Other people climb mountains for a challenge, or go racing around a motor track at 200mph; our extreme sport is the challenge of staying alive. - The Right People Around Us We don't want to be judgemental but a lot of people, perhaps most people, are really not going to be very helpful to us. They may have the sweetest dispositions and interesting lives, but in essence, they will never be able to understand us (to put it more accurately, their circumstances mean they will never feel a need to understand our minds and good for them, we would be the same if we were any luckier) and their experiences will always feel remote and alien as a result. We need to seek out people who either know the condition from the inside or - because of some fortuitous bend in their minds - feel somehow instinctively close to it anyway. We need people who can let us despair but also know how to encourage us to laugh; people who won't accuse us of malingering, or making a meal out of nothing; who won't look wide eyed and full of judgement as we detail what we have been up to and some of the wildest thoughts that course through us in the early hours. We need - more than most - a lot of love. And yet (of course) we'll be unusually inept at finding it, as damaged people are. - Care We need to remain at all times vigilant, knowing how susceptible we are. One of the enemies we have to deal with is our own sudden assumptions that we might, after all, be well again. So we need to be always on our guard as to the likelihood of a relapse. We should formulate plans but hold on to them very lightly. We should realise the link between busy-ness and mania and take extreme measures to live soberly. We should acknowledge, and fully honour, the differences between ourselves and other more robust people."

    "Transcript": "We might assume that our great longing in relationships would be to be looked after by someone; an exceptionally kind person who could listen to us, nurture us, assist us and make us feel comforted and seen. But this is to ignore just how strong there is - in some of us - a diametrically opposed aspiration: a wish to find someone who is in a lot of pain and trouble, who is confused and sad, unhappy and overwhelmed, and who cannot therefore possibly do very much for us, but who we, on the other hand, have every opportunity to hold, appease, calm, and heal. For this group among us, troubles aren't just nuisances to be managed, they lie at the core of what we positively desire to find in others. We feel our heart tighten when we learn that someone had a difficult childhood, or is isolated and adrift or has been bullied at work or made to feel worthless in a past relationship. These are not merely regrettable incidentals, they lie at the centre of our feelings of love. For us to be this way, there tends to have been a certain sort of childhood. Something has happened to us early on which means that giving assistance has become decisively easier than receiving it. We might say that everyone, at the start, longs to receive love. But when it has not been especially forthcoming, one way to handle its absence is to turn into a compulsive caregiver; to offer others what we wish could have been offered to us, to turn our deficiency into a bounty, to locate the needy part of us in someone else and then to heal it in them as an alternative to addressing it in ourselves. When we have had to forego our wish to be nurtured and understood - because mum was elsewhere or dad low in spirits - we might have begun by looking after our teddy bear, then moved on to friends, and eventually in adulthood, discovered our greatest satisfaction in salving the woes of our lovers. We may now be rendered hugely uncomfortable whenever the tables turn even for a moment. If a lover said, 'tonight it's going to be all about you,' we would flinch. To hear 'I want to put you at the centre of my world' could bring on panic. It's not that such care isn't fundamentally wanted, it's that it was never experienced and so has grown alien and frightening, a reminder of a wound we haven't been strong enough to contemplate, rage at and move on from. The way out of our cul-de-sac is to start to notice how scared we are. We may have justified our behaviour by thinking of ourselves principally as selfless. But we are something more complicated and more interesting: terrified. We aren't just without reciprocity, we are manically intolerant of it. And yet, as we still stand to discover, sometimes, the real generosity is to let a lover do to us what a parent did not at the start. It's to stop occupying the powerful position of the rescuer and learn, at points, to take the risk of being at another mercy's. It's to experience - as if for the first time - how much we need someone else. Real maturity may be as much about a capacity to receive as to give."

    "Title": "A Dark Way to Predict what might happen in your relationship",
    "Transcript": "A dark and frightening way to predict what might happen in your relationship with a new person is to ask them what happened to them in their childhood. Often, we stand to hear a sad and sombre tale, in which our partner was cast in the role of a victim (as children typically are). For example: - at a young age, their parents turned against your partner and diverted their attention to a younger sibling. They became deaf to their calls for attention and treated them unreliably - and then denied that they had done so, scrambling the poor child's sense of reality. Or: - their parents didn't give them warmth and care and left them feeling that there was something wrong with them for wanting love. Or: - their parents humiliated them for not being 'good enough', perhaps not sufficiently cultured or sporty, sociable or tidy. In the early days, we are liable to be extremely sympathetic to these stories. Our heart reaches out to the younger version of our companion, whom we would have wanted to hug tightly and reassure. However, it can be a long time - as many as three to four years - before something more alarming comes into view, which we very often aren't able to analyse or interpret, let alone prevent. Our partner may (unconsciously) start to enact in our relationship the very same dynamic as they experienced in their childhood - but with one key difference. This time, they are in the role of the perpetrator and we (unwittingly) are cast in the role of their victim. So for example: - our partner may mysteriously cool on us, and begin to get highly attached to a friend or a colleague. When we complain and ask for their love back, they pretend that we are 'imagining' that they are being distant or unreliable, leaving us puzzled as to what might be unfolding. Or: - our partner may withdraw from us emotionally and sexually, leaving us knocking at the castle door, hoping to be let back in. Or: - our partner may start to become snide and mocking about our apparent insufficiencies, calling us uncreative or uncultured, which had never appeared to bother them before. What on earth is going on? The explanation may run like this. In the deep minds of our partner, it appears that there are really only two positions that one can adopt in a relationship. Either one is the perpetrator. Or one is the victim. This is - after all - exactly what their childhood taught them. And in the choice between these two, rather naturally, our partner has decided to adopt the exclusively safe stance that their parents once enjoyed, the perpetrator role, and then cast us as their victim. We must suffer in the way they did - for only then can they feel (in the recesses of their psyches) that they are not going to be tormented all over again. Their behaviour is letting us know what they had to go through - and are dementedly keen never to have to endure again. The way out of this horrific possibility is to become hugely aware of it, to bring it into circulation in the couple and to search for evidence of it in oneself and the other. More profoundly, the task is to start to see that - unlike what childhood may have taught - there is in fact very much one central and redeeming alternative available to being a victim or a perpetrator. There is a role that - tragically - no one showed a child as their mind was forming but that is true goal of all genuine loving relationships: that of being the nurturer, the one who heals, who offers, who comforts and who cares, the one we are all craving to have and, in our healthier moments, are all longing to be."

    "Transcript": "A significant and intense chunk of our lives may be spent pondering 'hard choices.' Should we continue in our relationship with X or part from them to see who else we might find? But what if we land on no one better? Yet what if we stay and the relationship never improves? Should we buy this property that's beautiful but worryingly close to the railway tracks? Or should we buy the other one that has less charm but might be quieter? Should we accept this job that has prestige and the possibility of a stellar future? Or should we stay where we are because we love our colleagues and have a high quality of life? Part of the agony of choosing at such moments is that we are in the background consumed by the idea that the 'wrong choice' may prove appalling in the extreme and the right choice a route to exceptional fulfilment. But we are perhaps suffering unnecessarily and might find reassurance in the strategic use of two kinds of thinking, alternately optimistic and pessimistic in tone. To trial the former, we might propose that part of the reason why certain choices feel so hard is that all options on the table have - in truth - something to offer us. The choice is only 'hard' because we are having to pick between substantially decent alternatives. We cannot choose because the choices before us are all pretty good. If we stayed with X, there would be much to celebrate. And if we went off and found someone else, they would have many charms too. As for the two homes we are judging between, both are really very pleasant in different ways. And the same holds true for our jobs. Whichever option we choose, we will have much to be pleased about. There is equal comfort to be found by running the argument in a pessimistic direction. We are obsessed by the idea that a wise choice will help to prevent a nightmare, but considered soberly, there will be something pretty difficult about every route we take. We are finding it hard to choose because all options have their unavoidably disappointing dimensions. X partner can certainly be annoying; but so will Y partner. Pretty much anyone we end up with is going to have their dispiriting sides. There is no dodging the inherent difficulty of everyone. As for property, no house can ever make life perfect. A lot of unhappiness will be ours wherever we happen to sleep. No house can spare us certain fundamental agonies of existence. Similarly, the dissatisfactions we know in our present job will have equivalents whatever job we pick. In other words, everything is certain to be a bit awful - a truth we are vainly striving to deny in our furious search for the 'right choice'. What powers the pain of choice is to a large extent an illusion: the idea of a single solution that can either conclusively deliver happiness or skirt unhappiness. We are exaggerating our agency. Once we recognise that by the time we are spending hours on a choice, anything we choose will be both pretty fine and simultaneously stubbornly somewhat awful too, we may cease to grow either quite so exercised or so terrified. We can afford to rest more easily. We are never far from pain; and we are never far from joy. We might let a roll of the dice decide the rest."

    "Title": "How to 'Grow'  - The Hard Truth About Growth",
    "Transcript": "Our societies are attached to a phrase which it can be a bit too easy to assume we understand. The talk is of people 'growing' and of having 'grown' which alludes to some kind of important psychological evolution and development. But what does 'growing' really involve? What is it we are developing a capacity to do when we so-called grow and what are we leaving behind? And, crucially, how might we train ourselves to grow a little more - and a little more quickly? What we may essentially be pointing to with the idea of growth is the ability to stop responding to situations in the present through lenses unconsciously distorted by our psychological histories and, especially, the quirks and biases bequeathed to us by our invariably somewhat complicated childhoods. A person who 'grows' is likely to be able to look more fairly at other people and situations - and to recognise the extent to which they might be aggravating conflict or heaping unwarranted suspicion or ruining their chances - because they bear within them presumptions shaped by hard-to-recall experiences of loneliness, fear, betrayal and humiliation. A person who has grown will more readily be able to check their first unhelpful responses to things and reach for a more complicated, objective set of explanations. It may not always have to be their companion's fault. Perhaps a mistake was - in this instance - innocent. It might be their role to say a small sorry. Maybe they've misunderstood what was really being meant. To grow is to acquire the courage for new sorts of questions: - What if I were repeatedly defending myself against closeness and hope? - What if I was using busy-ness to block encounters with my own mind? - What if I secretly manoeuvred to end a relationship prematurely because I felt safe with feelings of isolation and rejection? - What if I was running away from opportunities to show myself authentically to others? These questions can, in personal life, be what we might in science describe as Copernican; questions that involve a fundamental rethinking of one's place in the order of things. The more one 'grows', the more one might have to give up a certain sort of confidence and certainty - not in the name of meekness or self-hatred, but for the sake of a newfound scepticism, a patient modesty and a humorous readiness to wryly acknowledge error and admit to fragility. A person who has grown might: - operate with a vivid sense of how much they misunderstand - appreciate their fear of intimacy and joy - more often say, 'I don't know' or 'Let me perhaps think more about that.' Even sometimes, on really special occasions, 'I think you may have a point.' - be more receptive to friendships built around a recoginition of vulnerability and anxiety. What spurs growth is - unfortunately - almost always pain. We grow because we were fired and then, already shattered, were finally able to look at what colleagues around us might have found difficult about us for many years. We grow because we lost a major love - and at last (as we weep in a corner of the airport lounge) see that we might have been far too guarded or demanding or frightened. We grow because, in an hour of need, we can't bear to be alone any more and realise (as if for the first time) what friendship could be for. The greatest sign of growth might be a readiness to calmly take on board the scale of one's silliness; how many basic things one is still learning; what a child one still is. A person who has grown won't see anything offensive at all, indeed will stoically accept the idea, that they have been, very often indeed, over some quite major things (if we can put this very politely) a bit of an idiot - and will be intensely committed to trying to be rather less of one in the precious time that remains."

    "Transcript": "Very occasionally, we get a glimpse of what it might be like to be truly happy. Maybe it's late at night on a summer's evening; perhaps we've just recovered from an illness; we might have been deeply affected by a book or a piece of music and have gone on a walk on our own through the city or the countryside. And suddenly a hugely mysterious thought descends on us: what if we didn't always have to be as sad and as anxious as we usually are? What if we could more properly appreciate the beauty and the potential that lie all around us? What if we noticed the trees and the interesting faces of strangers? What if we allowed ourselves to connect more deeply with people around us? What if we let go of our normal reserve and suspicion and fear? What if we surrendered to loving and to being loved? We intimate a possibility of joy on a vastly different scale to that which we ordinarily countenance. The standard, somewhat exasperated arguments against any such moods go like this. We need to sober up. We're not shamans or visionaries; there are some fixed, grand and important reasons why life is fundamentally awful. We have to earn a living. Our partner is often scratchy. People are mean. There is the house to look after. But more existentially, this is a journey of suffering. We didn't get to where we are today by training our eyes on the upsides. It all sounds sensible enough and surely on certain days, there is a great deal of logic here too. But what if the 'reality' we speak of doesn't fixedly ask anything as grim of us as we suppose? What if there are no genuine necessities that preclude higher levels of happiness; what if it was principally our own distorted psychology that gets in the way of a richer life? Many of us did not grow up in an atmosphere where joy was rewarded or deemed possible for long. Our childish appetite for giggling soon died down. Our parents may have been extremely worried, angry or sad, and we quickly got the message that we needed to keep our heads down and prepare ourselves for long winters of emotional deprivation. We became good students of a downbeat mindset; we attached ourselves to a philosophy of sadness. We learnt to expect little. Not for us states of runaway ecstasy, nor possibilities of love, nor transports of delight at being on the planet. Without necessarily noticing what happened and why, we developed into people who remain loyal to what was implicitly demanded of them in their early years; we are still in a mentality we were quietly coached for and had no alternative to aged seven or fourteen. But what if there were, in our adulthood, at this stage in our lives, no ongoing reasons to keep holding onto sadness and worry with our customary energy? What if we could dare to become fundamentally different, more open to joy and able to bear hope? We might go into friendships expecting that they could become sources of satisfaction, we might pick partners who didn't reinforce our sense of isolation; we might set up our interactions with others so that they could succeed. We might - in time - take on board one of the most shocking of all thoughts: what if we are not here to suffer? What if we could relocate our misery to where it belongs, a past we weren't able to choose, and aimed for something different going forward? What if we allowed ourselves to become more regular visitors to those still very unknown and understandably terrifying uplands of joy? We won't change this around in a day - or in an essay. But we might derive benefit from every spur we can get."

They told us they hated a particular person we were suspicious of; they've had lunch with them yesterday. They assured us they had no ambitions in a particular area; their search history suggests otherwise. We might - in irritation - be tempted to label our companion 'a liar' or 'deceitful.' But something more poignant is at play. What we have on our hands is that most benighted of psychological types: the people-pleaser, a harried soul morbidly fearful of expressing their true opinions lest these clash with those of others and prone to initiating a variety of secret agendas in the hope of continuing to be liked. People-pleasers are hard enough at the office and in ordinary friendships. They are especially tricky in love for their behaviour so carefully tickles the area of our most profound hope: that someone - at last - agrees with us. It isn't that the people-pleaser is deep down entirely at odds with us; that would be too neat and in a sense simple enough to deal with. It's just we can't easily tell where natural alignment ends and manic subservient agreement begins; what should we make of this musical enthusiasm? Do they really think exactly as we do about money? The questions get ever larger and more consequential: is their sexuality really what they say? Do they actually want to get married? The tragedy is that the people-pleaser is deep down just horribly afraid. Something in their past has proved to them that they can never be forgiven for speaking their minds. Their childhoods have been a lesson in the importance of shape shifting. Surrounding cruelty means they have had to grow into geniuses at detecting what the other person wants - and at serving it up to them with near-total fidelity. We know what we need to do in theory: to give our companion a repeated taste of the acceptability of their true tastes in music, pasta, friendship and existence. The problem is that we tend to get so upset when we stumble on examples of incongruent behaviour that we do precisely the opposite. We lose our tempers at their subterfuges and thereby enforce their very worst fears: that honesty never pays, that they must just lie better next time. Humour may have to be the answer. As early as we can, we need to give them a toy chameleon as a gift - and send the animals as emojis with a question mark whenever they outline their wishes for the weekend or show deep enthusiasm for our career plans. We have to show that a clashes in views need not be a catastrophe. That when there is genuine love, of the kind there never was at their origins, differences can be survivable, that in a functioning relationship, an argument is invariably better than a lie."

    "Title": "Why It Can Take Us So Long to Understand How Unwell We Are",
    "Transcript": "A lot about our behaviour doesn't make sense until we can take on board a basic idea about the way we humans are built: that our biology privileges survival over self-awareness. In other words, the most important priority for members of our species is to live and to keep going, not to pause, understand and take stock. Place any new human in a terrible circumstance - let's say, in a home with a violent or alcoholic parent, or an abusive or depressed one - and it won't, as one might imagine it could, be able to focus clearly on what has gone wrong or mourn its condition. It will simply - as we've ascertained it must - keep going. In order to do this, it will call upon a range of innate survival techniques. It may start to think surprisingly well of its parents, declaring them justified in their beatings, selfishness and humiliation. It might assiduously blame itself rather than sparing any pity for its own deprivations. Let's remember that a sense of self-compassion can be a very dangerous thing indeed when one is five years old and no one would listen even if one yelled. Or else it will ward off despair through activity: it will over-achieve at school. Or break windows. Or become obsessed with drugs or sport or politics; anything not to have to listen to the buzz inside. The benighted child can't look back, it can't glance down. It must simply stare ahead at the main goal: survival. This priority can last for a very long time indeed. After all, a sense of external security isn't remotely assured for most of us until we have settled in a career, built up some capital, bought a home, found a spouse, maybe had some children. By which time we might in our 40s or 50s. Yet our excellence at survival doesn't take away from the basic fact of our situation. We have been born into a mess. We have the ingredients of madness inside us. We have been unmoored by cruelty. We are (quietly, in the recesses of our soul) close to insanity at points, the ineluctable result of too much suffering encountered too soon. But as the external world gets ever safer for us, the internal world has a chance to feel as troubled as it always has been. We may feel stranger inside at forty than at twenty - even though the causes of our disturbances lie in events far closer to the latter date than the former. Eventually, the pent up fear and sadness are liable to find a way through. We'll start to do something odd: write long letters to strangers or crash the car or sob in public. Or develop a certainty that the government is following us. The legacy of the unkindness of which we've been the recipients begins to emerge. With any luck, we may soon enough wind up in a clinic - or the consulting room of an experienced therapist. And here have a chance to find out more about the sadness and loss that have been inside us since the start. We may finally feel safe enough to let out a very long scream - and meet with the love and understanding that were our due from the start."

    "Title": "The Avoidant Partner with the Power to Drive You Mad",
    "Transcript": "Many relationships will help to keep you a sane; a few varieties have the power - and we're not being hyperbolic - to make you lose your sanity. So that we might be forewarned or just helped to feel less lonely and given a map with which to escape our labyrinth, the archetypal despair-inducing love story has the following characteristics to it. Firstly, a lover who seems terrific. They are nice looking, they are clever, they make you laugh - and crucially, they seem to like you. They profess love, they want to be with you for the long term (a thrilling idea to you). But then a cycle begins. Just after a certain amount of niceness has been established, something occurs. It may be quite an obvious and large thing but - for true madness to be generated - it is more likely to be pretty small, so small you wonder if you are imagining things: - the partner acts in a rather distracted and grumpy way. You're in a beautiful spot near a river, but they're not looking. They might be using their phone a lot. When asked what's wrong, they repeatedly and unconvincingly say, 'Nothing.' - another time, you come home looking forward to seeing them. But you sense, not for the first time, an odd disengagement. They say they are feeling 'a bit weird.' They seem elsewhere. You try to be sensitive around them - and leave them to it - but a peculiar atmosphere descends that you can't quite make sense of. They keep messaging people. - you are looking forward to spending a pleasant weekend together after a period apart. But a few hours into Saturday morning, they announce that - very sadly - they have a party to go to with friends on the other side of town. They'll be off at 5pm and probably won't come back till the next morning. They're so sorry - especially as you're not invited. They leave the house looking pretty trim. - they return home from a visit to a museum. You ask them about the art. They are more interested in telling you about someone they spotted with lovely hair whom they felt very attracted to and kept bumping into in different galleries and even in the gift shop. How nice they'd be to go to bed with! You try to be a sport and rein in your jealousy - but it's not entirely easy - especially as it's not so long ago that you had to hear the story of how very lovely the taxi driver was. - it's been a while since you made love; you hint that it might be a nice idea, but - once again - there seems to be a problem. It's not the right moment, it's too hot or too cold, they are tired, they have indigestion or a bad back or stress about the next day. You try to be understanding but turn over on your side with, once more, a little pain in your heart. Eventually, after an accumulation of these rebuffs, you lose your patience. Despite having been a good boy or girl for a while and tried to believe what you needed to believe, something that the lover does acts as the proverbial straw on the camel's back. Once again, they are aggressive on the phone, once again, they flirt with someone else, once again, they shut you out of their social life. You're not sure you want this forever. They're a lovely person in parts, but there's something off here. And so, with tact and gentleness or a build-up of irritation, you declare that you've had enough. The partner doesn't respond very well. You're imagining things, it's nothing, you're too sensitive, you're throwing away love, you're being ungrateful and difficult. But you leave anyway - and restart an independent life. However, anything from a few hours to a few days to a few weeks after, the tricky partner gets back in touch and says a number of extremely powerful things. They adore you; they're so sorry; they want to be with you. You're right; they'll do far, far better next time. These are highly seductive messages. After all, you never wanted to leave this person; you wanted to be close to them. It's just that you sensed that in a variety of ways, they were keeping you at bay by acting in an off, offensive or distant manner. But now they appear to notice what they previously had not, and look willing to make some changes. So of course, why not go back? The couple reunite. You go out for dinner. The old intimacy returns. Affection resumes. Until, a few hours or days or weeks after, the problems rear their head again. Once more, the partner goes distant, once more, they flirt with a stranger, once more, they are disengaged or aggressive. On and on it can go. There might be years of it. What is at play? We need to recognise an awkward and very peculiar fact of psychology. There are people who very much want love - until the moment it is offered to them. Psychotherapists call these people avoidant; we might call them tricky or maddening. Something in their past means that the realisation of their wishes is more terrifying than delightful, and they will therefore take careful steps - unconsciously - to re-establish distance whenever too much proximity is established. Without understanding what they are doing and therefore without admitting to their behaviour or allowing that you may have a point when you hold up a mirror to it (this is where you can end up losing your mind), they'll go cold or look elsewhere as soon as they feel that a partner is entirely committed to them. They cannot stand too much niceness or proximity. The difficulty is that the moment their lover gets annoyed with them and takes steps to leave, they rediscover their love for them - and reel them back in with energy and skill. They want you most just when you are dangling from the cliff edge. Only to push you away again once you have clambered back up onto the ledge and are standing close. What to do if we happen to find ourselves in a situation that sounds like this? To start with, imagine that we are not deluded, whatever our partner tells us with energy. There are whole books and academic papers on the phenomenon. We can get interested in our lover's past. Is this someone who was reliably cared for in childhood? Or was it not - more likely - someone who tried to put their trust in people who constantly went cold and rejected them? Might they be doing to you a version of what was done to them? Next, examine your own motives; what is satisfying for you in being in such a situation? Is there something you might be trying to repair in your past by throwing yourself again and again at the feet of a distracted and intermittent person? Do you, in your own way (a truly arduous thought) have as much difficulty receiving love as they do? Finally, visit a graveyard. Observe the brevity of life. Look over at couples who are not as tortured as you are. Ask yourself whether you want this to go on forever or whether you might not be ready to try out something new. Wonder if you are not done with the perils of avoidantly attached people - and might not at last be brave enough to let into your life someone as willing to receive love as to give it."

    "Transcript": "It would be nice to believe that nothing much happens to young children who grow up around violent or angry parents and care-givers. It would be so nice to believe they could simply brush off their experiences and keep an unblemished faith in life and in themselves. But the more psychologists have studied children, the more they've realised something extremely daunting: that we are all in fact hugely susceptible to the moods of the people around us. Expose people to violent tempers early on, and the scars can last a lifetime. At the University of Washington's Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences, psychologist Professor Betty Repacholi and her team have carried out a riveting experiment to show what can happen to a sensitive child - that is, to every child - who comes in the vicinity of a raised, angry voice. Watch how this fifteen month old boy responds. In a safe environment, a child is free to explore joyfully. [Wait a bit in the film to find a suitable place for the next sentence] But when there is some kind of danger, represented here by a so-called 'emoter', curiosity quickly gives way to fear. This fifteen month old was lucky. He was sitting on the lap of his loving mother; and was quickly comforted. But many of us are less fortunate - and it's life itself, rather than just a pink set of beads, that we have as a consequence grown too frightened to explore. We should show ourselves immense compassion - and strive with all our intelligence to create a world in which there might henceforth be a lot less rage - and fewer cowed traumatised children."

    "Transcript": "It may sound ungenerous to throw the emphasis on the negative but we can fairly say that people who are good at love know - first and foremost - who not to fall in love with. While they may have all sorts of friends and a wide sympathy for the vagaries of being human, when it comes to who they opt to tie themselves to, this is some of what they will avoid with determination: - People who have no sense of how difficult they are to live with. - People with a heightened belief in their infallibility. - People who will, when something is pointed out to them, quickly chose the occasion to simultaneously inform you that: 'It's not as though you're perfect either…' - People who will label any criticism of them (however sensitively delivered) as 'rude' or 'offensive' and contrary to the rules of true love as they define these. - People who deliberately drive you to the edge of frustration, then turn and say: 'why are you getting cross so suddenly?' - People who smile and say, 'I get it completely now; I'm going to change,' and then go and do whatever it was all over again a few days later. People who combine an exquisite talent for upset with an even greater talent for sentimental apology. - People who will flirt with others, then call it 'only a bit of fun' and label you a prude for minding. - People who will mess up your house and call you 'anal'; people who will prioritise time with their friends over time with you and then call you 'controlling.' - People who tell you you are 'imagining things' a lot. - People who harbour a background grudge against your gender. - People who are furious with a parent and don't realise they are. - People who can't forgive anyone who thinks better of them than they think of themselves. - People who claim desperately to want a relationship - but are inwardly so committed to distrust, isolation and self-hatred that they are in no position to really have one - yet don't know this of themselves. - People who principally associate love with the pleasant feelings they register when you are nice to them. - People who don't take your love as a substantial gift you chose to bestow every day and could take elsewhere. - People who don't realise your time is very, very precious. - People who are far too in pain to know how to want the best for you. - People who refuse to do the necessary work. Let's remember; the people in the list above comprise some of the most charming, beautiful, vivacious, seductive characters on the planet. But their traits also mean that you will be headed for substantial challenges in any extended involvement with them. It may take years to work out that they use words like 'love' without knowing what they should entail or that they have systematically shredded your confidence in your judgement in order to avoid acknowledging a raft of their own difficulties. Lovers who know to avoid them are not cleverer than the rest of us. They have just had the good fortune to be looked after early on by people who were tender and sweet and therefore now know how to associate relationships with fulfilment rather than frustration and longing. Through immense good luck, they simply have no interest in suffering. They have via experience learnt one of life's most important lessons: that the point of a relationship is to be mutually delighted by another person. As we may eventually realise, we aren't alive long enough for anything else."

    "Title": "Empty Chair Therapy: Heal Your Past, Improve Your Future",
    "Transcript": "One of the simplest and most useful exercises that psychotherapy has gifted to us is known as the Empty Chair Technique. A client who has been wrestling with their feelings towards someone is gently requested to stop discussing them in the third person and is instead invited to face a chair and start talking to this bit of furniture as if there were on it - to all intents - the specific troubling person in their life, perhaps a long dead absent father, a neglectful mother or a traitorous so-called friend. Many of us spend a good deal of time ruminating on difficult people in the recesses of our minds. We say that so-and-so 'really deserves a comeuppance' or that we would 'love to give X or Y a taste of what we actually think.' We find ourselves returning to them again and again late at night and on the journey to work, their offences interrupting our sleep and spoiling our digestion. And yet we rarely speak with any degree of clarity or sincerity - out of fear of retribution, dread of vulnerability, pessimism as to the chances of being understood or perhaps stubbornly ingrained good manners. The feelings remain in us in a latent form, contributing to a layer of static frustration that damages our health and lends a compulsive quality to our moods. Now, under the aegis of a therapist, we can give form to our cloudy annoyance. Once we move past a hesitation at the particular strangeness of discoursing with a seat, we may find that we are a great deal more eloquent than we supposed, far more sure of what we needed to say; far more at home with letting the world energetically know how things look through our eyes. 'Dad, why did you have children if you couldn't ever be bothered to get to know them? Why did you think that your responsibility stopped at providing for them materially?' 'Chris, why do you pretend that you don't want to be intrusive when in fact, you just never take an interest in me - despite the hours that I have listened to your troubles?' All this might not seem so different from previous remarks like 'I'm pretty angry with X or Y…' but the impact of a concrete articulation and public audition is of a different order. Anger is a poison - and to speak it is to drain it of its malevolent power. We falsely imagine that the only speeches we can ever usefully make are to flesh and blood attentive listeners; in truth, it may matter far less that we are heard than that we have a chance to speak. The Empty Chair Technique is liable to be especially helpful to those of us who had to grow up to be extremely good boys and girls. There may be few opportunities to be anything but when dad is an alcoholic or has a violent temper, mum is neglectful or a sibling is very ill. We may lack any knowledge of how to complain because, in our formative period, we sensed correctly that our survival depended upon meekness and good humour. We learnt to smile and appease, when we would have needed a long wail at the unfairness and cruelty of it all. Our silence may have won us a safe enough passage into adulthood; its ongoing nature threatens to ruin the remaining years. We may fear that we won't be able to get too far into a speech without either collapsing into humiliating tears or escalating into unmanageable fury. The Empty Chair Technique can reassure us on both fronts. There can be ways of speaking without shouting, of saying 'no' without being alarming, of standing up for ourselves without coming across as entitled or unworthy. We can assert our needs without bringing about the catastrophe we fear. And we can start right now, without even waiting for a psychotherapist, by looking across the room to the nearest available chair and asking: who should be sitting there? And what have I needed to tell them for the longest time?"

    "Transcript": "For some of us, our lives are guided - and hemmed in - by one overwhelming imperative: we must never let people down. Not just a few friends and family members, but pretty much anyone who wants anything of us. Perhaps someone wants to see us again for supper. We kept them entertained and now they want more. The problem is that we really don't much like them - but we go anyway, because how could we not, next time and probably the twenty times after that. We give money to people we don't trust, we stay up too late at parties we hate, we wind up on holiday with characters we have little in common with. We would feel a sense of obligation to someone we'd just met on a tram or to a dog that wanted us to keep throwing a ball. On our gravestone it might as well say: got here a lot earlier out of an inability to say no. It gets worse the kinder a person happens to be to us - and the more emotional the relationship. If we develop reservations about a partner, we'll smile bravely when they speak of meeting up with their parents, moving in - or getting married. Who are we to have a contrary view? What gives us the right to turn away enthusiasm, simply because we happen to feel a little uncomfortable and intermittently somewhat nauseous? There tends to be a history behind our feelings of obligation. Way back, people around us were likely not to have been overly interested in our sincere needs. What did it matter how we were feeling about school or a friend or the strange pain in our tummy - when they, the big important person, had something properly vital going on in their world? We might have needed to tread extremely carefully lest we encourage yet another bout of rage or self-pitying explosion. Probably best not to mention that we needed the bathroom or weren't having fun in the museum or would really have liked another slice of cake. A manic sense of obligation is the logical consequence of key people's historic lack of obligation towards us. The way out of our knots is to start to take them seriously. This isn't just part of what everyone has to do. At this pitch, it's an illness. We need to learn the foreign language of honesty: I don't want to be with this person any more - even though we had some nice times. I don't want to see this friend any more - even though they have some good qualities. I don't need to give them what they want - even if they tell me they adore me. We can be shocked by the discovery of our backbone. We had believed we were 'nice'; now we sense an obligation to someone beyond the first person who believes we can be useful to them. Along the way, we learn that the consequence of disappointing people is almost never what we fear. Not everyone is like our fragile father or irate mother. Most adults can take a 'no', and may even be grateful to us for putting boundaries on their demands. There is an option beyond the dichotomy of meek compliance on the one hand and volcanic fury on the other: we can be at once civil and firm, polite and definitive. 'I would have loved to see you, but my health isn't so good at the moment, so let me be the one to get back in touch when I'm up for it…' 'Thank you for your kind offer. I'd have loved to take you up on this, but circumstances make it sadly impossible, forgive me…' 'You're an exceptional person, and I've so enjoyed our time together, but having thought deeply, I'm not ready to continue…' There should be this sort of stuff at school for those of us who never got it at home - and remain awkward about asking where the bathroom might be. We'll have made progress when we learn to love being kind to ourselves more than we fear momentarily frustrating those we may not even like."

    "Transcript": "We keep forgetting this lesson, even though it is - quite literally - written above us in the sky, as if someone at the moment of creation knew we'd have trouble keeping it in mind: we are made of moods, our spirits are constantly in motion, like the restless procession of weather fronts across a temperamental sky. Therefore nothing can be stable for long: a serene beautiful day will, almost inevitably, be followed by an overcast one, a still morning by a blustery afternoon, a vicious storm by a serene sunset. We keep striving for fixed positions, as if we were made of stone: this is what I believe, this who I like, this is what I want… And then the universe laughs and gives us a headache, a bad night, indigestion, a moment of euphoria, an energetic libido, a bout of conscience - and everything is once more upended. We should proceed more cautiously. In the quiet of our minds, so as not to alarm those around us, we should caveat the majority of our ideological positions with a humble 'for now…' This job seems to make enormous sense… for now. I feel I've worked things out… for now. This is who I am… for now. None of us are ever more than a few shifts in serotonin levels away from a transformation of heart. There is in our changeability an almost comedic interplay between what we might crudely refer to as our bodies and our minds; our higher faculties and our basic plumbing. We may feel that our perspectives on politics or love, the quality of a book or our assessment of a friend are built on disinterested, solid ground. We feel sure that the nobler parts of us are guiding our ideas, we don't recognise the extent to which what we are convinced of at a given point is really the outcome of how much sleep we've had or what is happening to our blood sugar levels. We'll solemnly declare life not worth living long before it occurs to us that we may urgently need to have a nap or reach for an orange juice. Keeping this at the front of our minds can help us to be more generous and accurate about those we live among. It may be - as they tell us with utter conviction at midnight in the kitchen - that they hate our guts or want never to see their mother again, or it might just be that it's time to get to bed and a heavy meal so late was not a good idea. Understanding that we are a patchwork of moods can be of particular assistance in those states when we can't see a single sliver of blue in the inner sky. We should have the experience to know that even though we don't - right at this moment - have any idea what will shift our condition, if we sit within the inner jet stream long enough and wait, something will eventually come along to push our horrors away. Just as, more sombrely, whenever we can no longer imagine any reason why we were ever sad, we should always remember the autumn gales. We stumble because of our tendency to too quickly declare 'this is me and always will be…' It almost never is; it's a heatwave, a squall, a shower, an Indian summer. We want to be solid and can be only air and water, gas and heat, current and front. We should take most of what we believe in at any single moment with wholehearted amused scepticism - and carry with us, always, an umbrella."

    "Title": "A Guide For the Recovering Avoidant",
    "Transcript": "'Avoidant' is the term usefully coined by attachment theorists to define those of us who, through no fault of our own but with full responsibility for our condition, have grave difficulties around intimate relationships. We may want - in principle - to be close to people, but in reality, we tend to find ourselves feeling claustrophobic and sickened whenever we grow overly involved with anyone. We long to sleep somewhere on our own after love making; we want to make independent plans for the weekend; we rather ungratefully cool whenever a partner becomes too affectionate towards us. Or if a relationship threatens to work, our thoughts turn as though by some automatic process to the charms of other people. Researchers tell us where this comes from: somewhere long in our pasts, our relationships with our caregivers did not go as they should have done. Someone let us down, someone implicitly taught us that love was not to be trusted, someone injected us with a dual suspicion of ourselves and of the solidity of any bond with another. And so we learnt to associate distance and solitude with safety. We may be high functioning in many parts of life; when it comes to love, we may - till now - simply never have been able to get things to work. It sounds dispiriting and even rather dangerous to be around but we can find hope in an important detail: that there is a substantial difference between acting avoidantly from unconscious motives on the one hand and on the other, feeling drawn to avoidant responses while being actively and preemptively aware of what is going on. There is a difference, in other words, between acting out and insight. The latter does not miraculously remove the problem but it gives us an enormous advantage: the capacity to warn others that we care about - and might well in a rational part of our minds be sincerely trying to build a relationship with - that we are not fully well. Arguably in love, we don't need - and are in any case unlikely to find - perfection; what we need are people with a more or less solid grasp on some of their leading imperfections who can then warn us of them with charm, grace and apology before too much damage has been done. There is a sizeable difference between ruining a weekend for someone by mysteriously deciding at the last moment that one has made other plans - and explaining to the partner on a Thursday evening that the prospect of 48 hours in their company, though fully welcome in theory, in practice has generated an awkward set of emotional responses that lie outside one's full control and for which one feels embarrassed and thoughtful. There is a sizeable difference between acting madly and sharing the temptation to do so ahead of time. For the recovering avoidant, the following speech might be helpful: 'I'm so sorry for being peculiar. I care about you a lot. It's just I've observed that when I do care, something odd happens. A part of me tries to manage the distance and find fault. A part of me, that dates back to a defence mechanism of childhood, needs to put some walls between us because proximity feels at some level odd and frightening. It's how I learnt to cope way back and the mechanism still operates within me now. It's not that I don't love you, it's that being around love and depending on someone brings with it terrors on account of dynamics in my past that I am working on. I am trying to switch off the alarm. I am a little crazy but I have a good therapist. I am committed to the work. Please bear with me - but I would understand entirely if you couldn't.' None of this is perfect, one wouldn't necessarily wish this kind of relationship on anyone one cared about. But in the real world, which is where many of us have to live, we cannot magic away the condition. The 25 percent or so of the population with avoidant traits have options. They can have all the neuroses that their condition lends them. They can feel eerie whenever someone is too close to them, they can want to get away after too much time together, they can hate cuddling, but they can put in the effort to acquire one advantage. They can know they are damaged. They can give a map of their follies to those who depend on them. Furthermore, once they have laid their hands on the maturity to be able to say 'I find love so hard and so frightening,' it might even become a little less so. And, on the other side of the equation, once one has been thoughtfully warned, one may just find the sad behaviour easier to bear or at least easier to understand and, where necessary, to get cleanly out of the way of. We don't just have the option of being avoidant or not. The madness can be invited into the relationship and addressed without shame or mystery. We can aspire to a valuable third position as we work on improving ourselves: that of the recovering avoidant, the avoidant under no illusions as to their sanity and daily committed to learning to slowly bear the ecstasy and sublime risks of mutual love."

    "Title": "A Writing Exercise to Help You Meet Yourself",
    "Transcript": "Usually, when we set out to write, sounding coherent and polished are our central priorities. We may think hard before setting anything down, we keep an eye on spelling, we may go back and correct words that feel not entirely right, we may delete a paragraph or two - all in the hope of eventually reaching a point where what we have articulated seems accurately to reflect what we truly think. But there is another philosophy of writing at large, this one with a very different thesis as to what 'good' writing might be like. While also believing that the ultimate ambition of writing should be the expression of our genuine thoughts, this technique proposes that our best chances of reaching such thoughts lies in making every effort not to think too much, not to agonise about every word, not to go back and correct anything - and instead, just to write down everything that comes into our minds the very moment it does so, without any interest in seeming logical, elegant, clever or even very sane. This approach, known as 'automatic writing', asks us to begin by picking an important emotional topic - for example, 'My Mother', 'My Father', 'My Partner' or 'What I Really Want' - and then writing as fast as we possibly can, for two minutes straight, without a single pause, which can feel like a very exhausting and peculiar requirement indeed. When we stand back and read what has tumbled out of us, our feelings about our parents, partners or desires may emerge as very different from what we had presumed. We might find that we hate where we had expected love; or love where we had imagined disdain. We might discover layers of longing, envy, rage or sadness that we had kept at bay day to day in the name of appearing that most stultifying and dangerous of things: normal. The value of the exercise lies precisely in the extent to which our automatic writing introduces us to feelings that are odds with those we ordinarily dare to entertain. Much of what we are is damned up inside us by scruples, by a fear of hurting others, by an embarrassment as to what we want when it departs from the expected path. Yet this neglect of our true selves is also what powers our anxiety, irritability, insomnia and depression, all of these species of revenge for the real thoughts we have been so careful not to allow into our conscious minds. Automatic writing will not make us into 'great' writers; but it will do something far more useful still: it will liberate us from some of the insincerities that are making us more troubled and restless than we should be. Our chaotic intense two-minute essays will help us to meet the person we have been, but were too scared to get to know, all along."

    "Title": "The Hidden Cost of Skipping Key Stages of Development",
    "Transcript": "One of the stranger aspects of the way we're built is that we need to go through a number of stages of development in childhood and adolescence in order to reach maturity - and if for whatever reason we miss out on any one of them, then a part of us will in the background be craving to return to finish the stage, even if it is one normally associated with being a toddler and we happen to be well into middle age. The central stages of childhood might be summarised like this: - The Adored Stage In which, in the very early months and years, on the basis of having accomplished nothing at all, we feel deeply accepted and approved of by our caregivers simply for being; because we have arrived on the earth, are defenceless and vulnerable and (perhaps) have a very cute button nose. - The Irresponsible Stage In which we can explore the world in a spirit of freewheeling curiosity without too many consequences or burdens. We can ask questions, we can try out what it's like to drop things on the floor, catapult pasta into the air or say bahhhh a hundred times. - The Naughty Stage In which we can give free reign to our desire to provoke, to be mean, to be jealous, to be a bit unkind and to flout the rules - while being forgiven and avoiding labels like evil or bad. - A Manners Stage In which we learn about the importance of being 'good', of making others happy and of fitting in with the demands of those around us. Adolescence brings with it further stages of development: - The Rebellious Stage In which we can shout at our parents, declare that we never wanted to be born, question every conceivable kind of authority and attempt to be very strange indeed. - The Sexually Exploratory Stage In which we can give licence to our burgeoning sexuality and find out who we really are and what we want in bed. - The Responsible Stage In which we find ourselves vocationally, submit to the demands of academia - and accede to the limitations and possibilities of employment. - The Emotionally Committed Stage In which we exchange the pleasures of sexual exploration for the complicated pleasures of a deep union. The difficulty with these stages is that they rely, in order to unfold, on a good enough facilitating environment. A rebellious stage requires parents who will put up with a degree of stroppiness and fury. An irresponsible stage requires caregivers who can allow us make a racket and leap up and down on the sofa for an hour. This is not a given. There may be depression, anger, a sick sibling, a divorce or some other factor that obliges us to jump to a pseudo or premature version of maturity. We can end up responsible before we have been rebellious; emotionally committed before we've been allowed to have a go at sexual exploration; or so-called kind before we've tried out naughtiness. That we have missed out on a stage may - unfortunately - be unapparent for many years. But the way we function means that eventually, the missing stage will force itself to be heard - perhaps at the cost of seriously upending our lives. We can state a general principle of psychological life: no stage that has been missed will ever easily leave us alone until it has been registered, honoured, sampled and exhausted. If we strive to suppress it, it will buckle and torment our psyches and bodies, until we recognise what has happened and take steps to correct the deficit. The idea of missing stages explains the phenomenon of the otherwise responsible lawyer who, at 42, suddenly leaves their family and young children in order to join a commune. Or who infuriates their bosses and makes a bizarre 'mistake' that gets them fired. Or the octogenarian who divorces their spouse because they realise that they were never held and simply allowed to be. Or the 67 year old who, over the course of a few months, takes to drink and shouts late at night in the garden to vent to an aggression and energy that they were never granted licence to indulge in their family of birth. We sometimes say - generally half in jest - that we would love to 'go back and be a baby for an afternoon.' The expression is telling. There are parts of us that continually ache to sample what we never had enough of. The best thing to do with a missing stage is - first and foremost - to recognise that it is missing and then to find the least dangerous and most effective way of sampling it, even as we try not to ruin or spoil the accomplishments of later stages of our lives. We may have to find a way to explain to a long-suffering spouse or friend or colleague that we missed out on the adored stage, the naughty stage or the sexually exploratory stage. It may not be easy for anyone. What this ultimately tells us is that we should never be rushed into maturity. Whenever we see a child or teenager and hear them described as 'old for their years' or 'already so grown up,' we should worry - and if this happened to be us, we should mourn. The world would be a lot calmer if all of its outwardly adult and yet inwardly bawling unhappy babies and furious toddlers had been given a chance to be who they needed to be at the age when it was safest and easiest for them to be so."

    "Title": "The Number One Rule for Healthy Relationships",
    "Transcript": "A basic rule to guarantee the health of any relationship is that we should try always to stick as close as possible to the truth of what we're really feeling - and to convey this to the partner in a way that they will understand, which in practice means, with as much kindness and politeness as we can possibly scrape together. We normally do things quite differently. We say: 'I don't care in the slightest when you come home, I'll be asleep anyway,' when we really mean: 'I miss you so much; I'm rather upset that you keep going out with your friends.' Or we say, 'Go to hell and die, I hate you,' when we really mean: 'I'm terrified of how much I depend on you.' Or we get into heated arguments about politics when we crave something far more domestic: a hug. Or we sternly criticise their timekeeping because they didn't ask more about our day. Or we find fault with their mother because we're furious that they have repeatedly sidestepped sex. Or we say, 'Will you stop fussing around the kitchen preparing things I don't even want to eat,' when we mean: 'I'm being cruel because I don't know how else to express my hurt.' Why can't we more often say what we mean? We aren't just being silly. None of this is simple. In a better arranged world, we would have Olympic competitions to focus our minds on, and celebrate, the skills involved, and the winners would be given large houses and often appear on television. To speak candidly yet kindly is as complicated as to play the violin and (perhaps) nju8a good deal more useful and beautiful. We don't say what we mean because we have no experience of anyone pulling off such a wondrous and mature feat anywhere around us. We were likely to have been brought up by people who said things like 'You're off my hands now, it doesn't matter to me what you do,' when they really meant 'I crave closeness and wish you would call more often.' Here are some examples of what we should try to do. Take A, and turn it into B: A: Shut the hell up about your stupid friends. B: I'm feeling a bit ignored at the moment; it's sounds a bit ridiculous I know, but I can't help but feeling a little bit jealous of how much time you seem to be spending with your mates. A: I never want to see you again, you stinking rat faced little shit. B: It seems I'm feeling really pretty upset at the moment - and it makes me want to take a bit of distance. I guess deep down I'm terrified you're going to abandon me. (8)Now over to you… A: I don't give a damn who you talk to at the party. B: A: Why didn't you tidy the kitchen? B: A: Fuck off and die. B: It's easy to get carried away with large plans for our futures. But we can improve them immeasurably with one modest-sounding, extremely difficult vow: to pause at key moments and ask ourselves: 'If I were gonna try and be three things - honest, kind and polite - what would I say now?' This could change our lives."

    "Transcript": "We tend to imagine that in order to live a good life, we need to have to have an appetite for the truth. But what if, in reality, in order to keep going and get anything done, we actually need to blind ourselves to a range of realities and have to swallow a number of illusions without which we couldn't possibly have the willpower to continue. Here are some of the blind spots necessary to our flourishing. First and foremost, we need to pretend that we're not going to die and therefore have to convince ourselves that all the things we fervently trust are so important and so urgent, really do matter and won't look like incomprehensible, futile mulch within a hundred years or less. We have to care manically about what 'others' think - though they hardly give us a thought, let alone a fair one. We have to imagine that we could (one day) be loved and understood - though few things are, in fact, ever more in doubt. We have to stay on our side - though we know, in our hearts, how beastly and strange we really are. We have to melt at the cuteness of small children - though we know how most of them will turn out and that the world we're teaching them about doesn't really exist. We have to look forward to the next few years with excitement - though almost every new day is a scratchy six or below. We have to believe that we're collectively making progress - though every invention unleashes a necessary set of appalling unintended consequences. We have to care about humanity - though most of its members are insufferable from close up. We have to look forward to the future - though if we had a chance to learn what fate had in store, we almost certainly would not want to know. We have to keep being excited about buying things - though we know how seldom any of them make a difference. We have to keep going travelling - though being somewhere else is always better in memory or anticipation. We have to keep seeing our so-called friends - though we would be crushed by hearing a fraction of what really goes through their minds. We have to believe in a comfortable, wise old age - though it will mostly be agony, aches and catheters. We have to not properly notice how beautiful, interesting and opportunity-filled life is - in case we were to go mad from excitement and regret. In short, let's not fool ourselves that we really want to know the full truth. We require only so much of it as is compatible with making it out of bed. We have to confront an uncomfortable fact about self-awareness: those who most know how to enjoy life may also be those who - at points - are masters at fruitfully lying to themselves."

They are the ones who long ago shed their pride, who can tell you frankly how lonely and sad they are, who can face their self-hatred and accept their regrets. They aren't just unhappy (there are plenty of boring and frightening ways to be that); they've come to an optimal perspective on their unhappiness. You could tell them about the strangest, oddest, most lamentable things about you and know that they understood it all at once from the inside. There are no follies around sex or status, love or money that they aren't fully acquainted with. They want to get to the howl inside you because they are so familiar with the howl inside them. They aren't remotely attached to seeming sane; they long ago ceased attempting to appear normal. They know that life is mostly pain, mystery and error - and will never try to persuade you otherwise. They will never be so mean as to try to cheer you up. They can be trusted because they have had the courage to fathom their full propensities to cowardice and corruption. They don't give a jot about your reputation - because they know enough what people in general are like. They combine a thorough misanthropy for the group with a deep love and tenderness for the individual. They've been through their obsessions with love, public esteem, career triumph and positivism - and come out the other side. They let their humour get very dark, because the gap between their hopes and their experience is so wide. They've gone into the weirdest bits of themselves and will therefore understand the oddest bits of you. They don't expect life as a whole to go right and, against a backdrop of despair, laugh with exceptional richness and glee. These are the sort of people you want in the prison cell or on the way to the scaffold, in the trenches or the bed next to you on the cancer ward. These are the kinds of people we need so many more of in our lives - and should try so hard to be for others."

It just grows convinced that it now hates mummy, that little brother should die, that the button falling off the cardigan is a catastrophe, that its self-respect depends on being allowed to throw the bread knife out of the window sharp end first. And it's the role of the parent to notice what is being overlooked - and say very gently but with deep conviction: Enough, we need to get you to bed, fast. We do ourselves no such service. We pay no such heed to how our bodies work and when our minds have ceased to do so. It's past 7pm; we might have had six hours of patchy sleep, been awake since 6.30 a.m, had four cups of coffee, answered 67 emails, crossed town twice, had four meetings, given two presentations, eaten four slices of pizza, watched 45 short viral films, read about fifteen conflicts and twelve scandals - and now, unbeknownst to us, we have entered a perilous zone in which we need to exercise extraordinary care to have any chance of managing a safe landing. We need to sense how much danger we are in; the danger of seeing only the idiocies of others as opposed to the reasons they might have committed them; the danger of perceiving accidents as intentions; the danger of being drawn to wound someone close to us to alleviate our rage at what the world in general has done to us; the danger of thinking that shouting might every now and then solve something. We're in danger of forgetting how much the day has gradually depleted our sense of perspective. We didn't do anything momentous or heroic, we didn't climb a mountain or perform heart surgery - and that is some of the problem. What will kill us in the end will not be one big obvious thing but many decades of invisible minor aggravations and low grade frictions. There is so much that we mustn't do. Talk about the need to tidy the upstairs cupboard. Bring up what we might do for the holidays; ask why we no longer have any fun. Pick this moment to go through the finances. We must insist to our passionate minds that our mounting anger about the chip in the wall, the missing sellotape and the way the partner said 'really' must be about something else - and this we will have to address at another time. We need to flag up to those we care about that, though this doesn't read on our faces, we have slipped into a hugely fragile state. With a mild smile, we can confess that we have, to all intents, gone mad. We need to show our love by escaping, we need to give ourselves a long bath and put ourselves in bed not much past nine, early for an adult but a very good time for an exhausted small bunny who has been very active since just after dawn. As kind people have been telling us from the start, it will all seem a lot more bearable in the morning."

    "Title": "A Question to Ask Ourselves When We Are Low and Paranoid",
    "Transcript": "A question to ask when we're feeling low and paranoid There's a difficult mood we're in danger of falling into that's made up of four elements in particular: low spirits, guilt, paranoia and irritability. In such a mood, we may feel guilty and ashamed without being able to put a finger on anything concrete we've done. At the same time, we're in a paranoid state of mind, as if people out there didn't like us especially, or we were in imminent danger of being found out for doing something forbidden. And then we might feel non-specifically irritable - and get uncommonly grumpy when we can't find a household item or the printer jams. It's in such a mood that we might step back and ask ourselves a distinctive question: Might I - at heart - be very angry with someone right now? It might sound peculiar that we would even need to ask such a question. Surely if we were angry, we would know immediately, without requiring any sort of formal moment of self-exploration. But this is to underestimate how difficult it can be - and what a psychological achievement it is - to be able to consciously know about and viscerally feel anger with a person who has actually angered us at roughly the time that they have done so. It can be so much easier to sink - instead - into a vague miasma of unknowing self-hatred and dread. Knowing when and with whom we might be angry relies on the privilege of having had permission - across childhood - to be aware of and then express anger against people who mattered to us, whom we loved but who - for a period - we happened also to be very frustrated with indeed. Not all parents are strong enough to allow their children to tell them how awful they are, what nonsense they speak or how completely fed up they feel. It takes considerable inner evolution to let oneself be spoken to in this way without lashing out or buckling; one has to feel really very big inside to cope with being told one knows nothing whatsoever by a livid seven year old. Too many parents shout back, punish or ask the child tearfully what they could possibly have done to deserve this kind of meanness. And so the child learns that anger, when it comes along, has to be swallowed - which tends to have four repercussions that decisively shape the emergent adult personality. Firstly, swallowed anger turns in on the person who feels it. When outward expression is censored, there is nowhere else for the rage to go other than back out onto the person who originated it. 'I hate you' becomes, 'I hate myself'. Secondly, swallowed anger breeds a sense of non-specific guilt. 'I wanted to harm you but couldn't' becomes, 'I've done something wrong, but I don't know what.' Thirdly, swallowed anger finds its way back out in the form of paranoia. 'I want to take revenge on you in particular' becomes, 'Everyone in general wants to do me in.' And fourthly, swallowed anger gets discharged onto 'safe' targets like bits of furniture or machinery (sometimes an unfortunate pet or kind spouse). 'I am livid with my colleague' becomes, 'Why on earth has the fridge door still not been fixed?' The next time we feel low, guilty, paranoid and irritable, we should pause to wonder whether we are not, in our depths, really very angry with someone right now. It could be an associate, a friend, a lover, a therapist or a long-dead parent. We need no longer be so unself-aware. Anger - held in sane adult hands - doesn't have to injure or destroy anything. It can be safely felt and then discharged in person with civility and caution or explored on one's own, in the pages of a journal or in the shower. Anger need not cause anyone injury; swallowed anger invariably will."

But that is too neat and we know it deep down; we know that there is also - alongside this - something more complicated that we use the idea of necessity to avoid. We work so hard because we are in terror of stillness. Because being scared of the world offers the most respectable distraction from a dread of our own minds. Because we have no idea how to let anyone know us outside of our achievements; because it seems inconceivable that we have any value beyond what we do. Because we were schooled early on in the art of being terrified - and are still too young to question our elders. Because we use the noise from without to drown the murmurs from within. Because we can't read poetry; for we despise anything that doesn't have a charted purpose or goal, and that threatens to collide us with the unexpected. Because we don't allow ourselves to be acquainted with the night. Because if we started with the questions, we have no idea where we might have to go - and what might need to be discarded. Because we are in flight from untenable sadness and regret. Because we haven't got too many (or even any) real friends. Because few people ever just held us quietly. Because we have no idea what to do with ourselves other than run. Because we find peace so much harder than war. Because the real work might lie elsewhere."

    "Title": "The Dangers of Oversharing",
    "Transcript": "We hear so much about the difficulties caused by those who cannot be intimate, who seem incapable of disclosing anything of what they genuinely feel, it can take time to register the opposite but no less grave problem: those who cannot keep enough of themselves to themselves, those whose hunger for closeness overwhelms their concern for their own safety, those who will, in a poignant bid to hold others' attention, lay out - within minutes of a new encounter - secrets that they would have been wiser to take to the grave. This isn't to deny the fun that oversharers can bring to social life. These won't be the types talking about the economic contraction or where they last went on holiday. Contact with other humans should be about getting to the marrow of things, they believe, which is why we will quickly get to hear about their ex's sexual difficulty, the vicious row they had about their mother's will, exactly how much they earn, the troubles they have with their digestion, their favourite bedroom position and the nature of an early childhood trauma. The difficulty lies in the toll these divulgences impose on oversharers themselves. An evening of entertainment is too often followed by a shame-ridden awakening. Now that the laughter has dissipated, they may feel as though they were seized by an impulse with which they don't identify; an urge to invite others into their deep self without the strength to impose the barest of checks on who they might be. A painful developmental story tends to lie behind the compulsion. We share too much when we have been too lonely; we fail to understand the risks of over exposure when we have suffered in environments in which so little sincere or real was ever exchanged. We rush to confess because no one showed us a steady, composed route to intimacy. To the isolated former child, no alarm sounds at the thought of having an unbarred conversation with a character who entered the room twenty minutes ago - such is the promise and lure of togetherness, such has been the burden of secrecy. There is no kind of armour in this direction, so often did the pain and danger come from elsewhere. We might with time make our peace with remaining somewhat more mysterious, we might more judiciously weigh up the benefits of a sugar rush of disclosure against the slower satisfactions of safety. We might tell very few people indeed what is going on for us in love, with our health or with work, not because we want to be unkind or boring, but because our first priority has become to look after ourselves. We don't have to answer too many intrusive question, nor - as importantly - do we need to ask them. It isn't - we can learn - any reason to panic if we are still talking about what someone did over the weekend or their favourite kind of gloves after the first course. We don't have to feel boring for ending up in many a boring conversation. We aren't dull at heart, we're just calmly working out (in a process that could take months or years) whether we've stumbled on one of those very rare characters who truly deserve to hear from the deepest parts of us."

    "Transcript": "we humans are extraordinarily and painfully vulnerable creatures especially in our early years we are at huge danger of being psychologically damaged by those around us damage is in one way or another always caused by a shortfall of tenderness and care as we might put it it's caused by a shortfall of Love examples of shortfalls of Love are very varied perhaps at an early point someone went missing or someone died someone was cruel or someone misunderstood and as a result of this deficit universally some kind of wound was sustained we are psychologically very ingenious creatures in the face of any wound we develop an array of very clever defense mechanisms the purpose of defense mechanisms is to protect us against further damage to help us to get through to the next stage of existence to keep us going in extremis to save our lives for example to protect us against this wound a parent who goes missing we develop this defense mechanism an inability to feel sad whenever anyone is absent or to protect us against an alcoholic caregiver we develop the defense of huge Independence and self-containment and so on the problem with our defense mechanisms is that they always exact a price while they protected us very well at a certain age the more time passes the more they become unsuited to the conditions that we face in the here and now what were once ingenious adaptations to a hostile environment become over the years the causes of behaviors that limit our chances and ruin things for us for example to return to the above table but with a new column on the right to protect us against this wound apparent who goes missing we develop this defense mechanism an inability to feel sad whenever anyone is absent and then the price of our defense mechanism is that our relationships are shallow and brittle or to protect us against an alcoholic caregiver we develop the defense mechanism of huge Independence and self-containment and then the price we can't depend on anyone a loneliness and further examples follow it's in the nature of how our minds work that we generally can't see the connection between how our defense mechanisms operate in the here and now and the wounds we sustained in the past these defense mechanisms give us what we call symptoms Syms we have a tendency to just accept these symptoms even if they're very painful often we don't even notice them for example we accept that we're not so good at love or we accept that we're quite lonely or we don't notice that we're manically cheerful or we don't notice how much we're underperforming at work in order to heal ourselves from our symptoms and the emotional wounds that lie beneath them we have to learn to understand ourselves better our happiness relies on becoming more self aware the more we can work at understanding ourselves the healthier Freer and more creative we can be how then can we unpick the legacy of emotional wounds self- understanding is a seven stage process firstly we need to learn to identify our symptoms for this we need to grow more ambitious about who we want to become in the future we need to scan the present and wonder how things could be improved we should ask what would I like to get rid of in myself what fruitless habits compulsions or areas of stuckness would I like to overcome what's more painful than it needs to be what patterns of difficulty can I notice once I look carefully secondly we need to identify our defense mechanisms these can be very hard to spot but it helps to consider a list of what some very common defense mechanisms are to see if they ring any bells we might never have thought of these things as defense mechanisms but we may nevertheless feel a moment of recognition when we hear of the following falling in love with unavailable people ensuring our relationships always fail underperforming at work being very independent addiction to alcohol porn exercise work feeling numb hypervigilance continuous anxiety constant sadness depression thirdly we're used to thinking of defense mechanisms in rather negative terms they're typically framed in problematic ways like illnesses that have no rationale they do cause us difficulties but to think of them negatively only doesn't allow us to understand that they actually have a logic and that it's only on the basis of understanding their logic that we can overcome them so long as we continue to see them as meaningless freakish aberration we'll never rid ourselves of them we must therefore learn to look at defense mechanisms as highly ingenious a very clever strategies that once would have done a very good job at keeping us safe we need to look for the upside of whatever defense mechanism we recognize in ourselves we should ask what was this defense mechanism clever at doing for us how did it help us how was it in its way rather wise and admirable so common defense mechanisms falling in love with unavailable people what's the clever upside of the defense mechanism we don't have to be let down or common defense mechanism of ensuring our relationships always fail what's the clever upside we don't need to experience loss underperforming at work what's the clever upside we don't have to risk generating Envy being very independent what's the clever upside no one can disappoint us and so on fourthly now we need to reconstruct why a defense mechanism was ever necessary in our life what was it about our past that would have made it necessary to have our specific defensive strategy in place what wounds did we sustain what happened in the past to make life difficult we might not be used to thinking in this way the past may be a long way back now but we need to proceed like archaeologists who try to reconstruct from the fragments in the here and now some of the circumstances of a bygone era let's add another column to our chart and try to fill it in as best we can so common defense mechanisms falling in love with unavailable people clever upside we don't have to be let down now what wound might we have suffered in the past to make this defense mechanism necessary maybe Mom was never there or imagine the common defense mechanism of ensuring our relationships always fail what's the clever upside we don't need to experience loss now what wound might we have suffered in the past to make a defense mechanism like this necessary perhaps dad was erratic or take the idea of underperforming at work what's the clever upside we don't have to risk generating Envy what wound might we have suffered in the past to make this defense mechanism necessary maybe there was an older sibling who was bullying and jealous and so on fifthly now we should do something very unfamiliar we should congratulate ourselves on having been rather clever with our defense mechanisms far from being some silly neurotic feature of Our Lives defense mechanisms have been an ingenious way of keeping us away from Devastation let's take a moment to feel proud of our smart Minds for devising a means of carrying us p danger onto the next stage of life let's feel compassion and admiration for our defensive strategy six now having given ourselves all due congratulations we then need to do something else realize that our defense mechanisms are in fact past their cell by date they were once undoubtedly pretty clever we can feel grateful to them but now they don't serve any purpose anymore now they make life worse than it needs to be in the circumstances of the present they aren't required we can afford to say goodbye to them indeed we must do so let's add another column to our chart to make it clear to ourselves how we're losing out because of a defense mechanism so common defense mechanism falling in love with unavailable people the clever upside of the defense mechanism we don't have to be let down what wound might we have suffered in the past to make a defense mechanism here necessary mom was never there and what price are we paying now for our defense mechanis M we can't enjoy intimacy or let's take another example common defense mechanism ensuring our relationships always fail what's the clever upside we don't need to experience loss what wound might we have suffered perhaps dad was erratic and what price are we paying now for our defense mechanism we haven't been able to have the family that we want and there are plenty of other kinds of price that we're paying now we're underselling ourselves we feel isolated our health is suffering badly life doesn't feel very real we're worried sick our Spirits are low seventh now that we have the following a defense mechanism in view its logic and its punishing price we are in an excellent position to carry out the next step deciding to say goodbye to the defense mechanism very gently we can let our minds know that the mechanism that once kept us safe can be let go of we can be safe in other ways indeed our future flourishing depends on us surrendering our hold on our Former Defense once it made sense to be numb now it no longer does once it made sense to be fiercely independent now it no longer does once we had to be sad and fearful now we can be hopeful and free"

    "Title": "The Secret Power of Missing Someone",
    "Transcript": "Missing someone that we're close to - because they've had to go to another country, or are up in the north on a course or went on a hiking trip with their friends - is such an unpleasant emotion, it feels peculiar to suggest that it is also, at a profound level, an extraordinary achievement and an important marker of emotional maturity. It is in no way simple for a prototypical adult to be able to miss anyone and we are often, almost without knowing it, engaged in complex manoeuvres to ensure that we resolutely won't. Small children - for better and for worse - miss people a lot. They show us - without compunction or defences - what missing looks like in its rawest, most unbounded state, and it is not always a pretty or relaxing sight. The wails can be heard across the street. 'Don't leave me,' a small child will scream with heart-rending intensity, as we implore them to understand that we just need to pop out to the shops and will be back in ten minutes. 'Why do you need to go?' they beg, as they hold onto our sleeve, their face streaked with tears, and we watch our plans disintegrate in contact with their despair. Eventually, a child grows up to feel ashamed of their early hysterics. Somewhere along the line, they give in to the many lectures they receive about the need to be reasonable and let others get on with their lives; something in them can no longer deny the logic that, yes, it probably does make some sense that the people we cherish have to be allowed to abandon us, perhaps for long stretches, like quarter of an hour, or god forbid, a day, even a month or sometimes (heavens above) years. It sounds like progress - but it should not obscure the dangers involved in growing up to be a very good little man or woman who everyone can be so proud of for the quiet way they now play with their toys when those they cherish vanish from sight. The risk is not merely that we become a bit more forebearing but that, in the name of reason, we cease to be able to feel anything much at all; that, in the process of growing up, we lose our capacity to love. We may grow so allergic to the pain that belongs to genuine attachment, we barricade ourselves behind a range of defensive manoeuvres. We may - for example - reconfigure who any person who leaves us can possibly be - in order that their absence might perturb us a little less. On the eve of a departure, we may abruptly realise that - whatever we had once assumed - the absconder is in reality horribly disorganised, they chew their food in a maddening way and they never have anything too interesting to say about the latest novels or scientific discoveries. It doesn't appear that we really have any particular cause to miss them very much, for why would we lament the absence of someone who was not especially worthwhile to begin with? Or we may go through the outward rituals of absence while privately not fully registering that anyone has actually really gone. When they call us from another continent in the late hours, we may find that we've just remembered that there's a crack in the ceiling we need to get on to in the morning - or an email we have to send to a supplier at work. We may find that it's impossible to accord them too much thought given how angry we have become about a dispute with a neighbour or how worried we are about an odd new twinge in our left knee. It's an immense achievement to be able both to care for someone and endure their absence, to feel a wound without resorting to numbness, rage or an affair, to miss someone without reinventing what the missing person means to us. We'll have begun to accede to genuine emotional maturity when we rediscover the courage to be hurt by those we love - when we can acknowledge, with some of the honesty of our younger selves, just how much it hurts when someone we adore crosses an ocean - or has the impudence to go off to the shops for an afternoon with their friends."

    "Title": "How to Tell If You're Afraid of Intimacy",
    "Transcript": "Sometimes we may end up in a couple where we spend a lot of time complaining - to concerned friends and family - that the other person is evidently and committedly 'afraid of intimacy.' They don't often talk of their emotions; they may find it hard to be physically cosy; they don't cry so often. Whereas we on the other hand - as all our acquaintances know - are the emotionally fluent ones. We long to be close to someone, we long to discuss our feelings openly and without restraint, we are healthy and ready for love. It's simply such a pity - and so profoundly unfortunate - that we have ended up with such an unyielding and resistant partner. But however genuine our cries for intimacy can sound, there is one incontrovertible fact in the way of their full credibility: that we actually chose our partner, and we did so not under duress, not because of some religious edict or familial injunction, but with our eyes fully open, in the light of day, with plenty of alternative options before us. This should at least complicate the story we are telling ourselves and our concerned and encouraging audience. There is arguably a limit to how interested in intimacy anyone can be who skilfully picks out the kind of partner who just happens to have precious little interest in the matter. Furthermore, examination of our day to day behaviour may reveal us to be too often acting in exactly the sort of irritable, belittling or persecutory ways that guarantee that we will never attain our stated aims of trust and connection. We cannot fairly claim to be on the one hand desperate for intimacy, and on the other, regularly call our partner incompetent or frigid, a blockhead or a brick for not being so. We must at least in part know that we won't be successful in securing the tenderness we say we so badly want - so long as we continue to ask for it in humiliating ways. A mature approach to the gridlock means taking on board a possibility that we may until now have been shielding ourselves from with devilish care: that we might both - in fact - be scared of intimacy and rather happy at its absence, that we might both - in truth - be fleeing from the terrors and joys of mutual surrender. Not because we are evil or demented, but because intimacy is exceptionally daunting to those whose early experiences and childhood stories have predisposed them towards guardedness and suspicion. A sincere path to intimacy begins with a graceful acknowledgement of the temptation to blame others for what we cannot bear in ourselves, and the acceptance that we may have far more in common with our partner than we have until now been able to concede. Whatever the surface differences, we are - in essence - just as scared and ambivalent as they are, a joint realisation with the power, finally, to bring about the compassion and tenderness we have both been in flight from for so long."

    "Transcript": "There is one question that, perhaps more than any other, gets to the root of who we are and what motivates us: What did I need to do in childhood to win the support and approval of my parents? We might - to sharpen the picture - need to lean on a few subsidiary enquiries: To please my father, I needed to… To please my mother, I needed to… Not to upset my mother, I needed to… Not to upset my father, I needed to… Whatever might be claimed, no family ever gives its offspring unconditional love; there is always, more or less subtly, something that one has to do and to be - and other things that must at all costs be skirted. When we look back, the commands may be obvious: we needed to do very well at school, or be highly musical or never usurp our father or little sister. In other cases, the commands will have been more disguised; we would have imbibed a general sense - emitted we know not how - that making a lot of money was vital or that sex was disgusting or that one's value lay almost entirely in one's looks or sporting ability. And sometimes, the commands would have been paradoxical to a degree we are still trying to untangle: 'you must be a winner, but if you are, we'll be threatened'. Or: 'try never to grow up because adult women or men frighten me'. Or: 'become extremely attached to me, so I can break your heart.' However much our attitudes and outlooks might be shaped by our countries of birth - by being Cambodian, French or Ghanian - we are always first and foremost citizens of those micro republics we call families, by being a Seang, a Béranger or a Boakye, each one of these lands equipped with a hugely idiosyncratic set of laws, expectations, patriotisms and tyrannies. Our nations may lend us a certain accent and civil code, our birth families tell us what constitutes a real man or woman, how much we can esteem ourselves, what we have to do to be admired and how much calm and fulfilment we deserve. If auditing these conditions of acceptance matters, it is because - to a far greater extent than we realise - they may still be in operation and make no sense at all. Decades after we left the republic of Niang, Smith, Kekoa or Banerji, we may still be taking immense care not to succeed too much - lest we anger a disappointed mother. we're still permanently trying to appease the bad moods of men in authority - in case they lose their temper violently, as a father did four decades before. Or we continue to expect an attack, as we did when we were in the hands of a highly damaged caregiver before our sixth birthday. If we are still in the mood for questions, we may need to wonder two things: 1. How much am I still doing of what I had to do back then? 2. And how much do I like - or dislike - the laws of yesteryear? We may find - to our disquiet - that we are continuing to apply to the present a set of edicts that long ago ceased to align with any of our sincere aspirations. We continue to act the clown, or the meek little girl, the terrified victim or daddy's favourite even when the republic of home has long been disbanded, its elite resigned and its borders obliterated. We may need to take stock of the highly distinctive mini country we've come from - and, in certain cases, before we waste yet more time, emigrate."

    "Transcript": "You're up in the middle of the night and again, you're in trouble in love. You had another discussion over dinner. You tried to get them to see that sometimes because of X, you do Y and they respond with Z - and it's unpleasant. And they countered - at first politely and then with great irritation - that even though A, you think B and that's why C is maddening to them. Both of you tried - pretty valiantly - to get your points across with calm and kindness. Both of you managed to be more or less polite, more or less restrained, more or less grown up. And by the end of the two hour conversation, you parted in an almost affectionate way and went to sleep in different rooms. But it's not enough and you know it. That's why you're up at 3am hearing the rain fall. You're pursued by questions: what do you keep doing wrong in love? Do you even belong together with this obviously very nice person? Why is it so hard? You briefly wonder what it would be like to leave. You picture some new dates. But the picture soon curdles; the horror of starting all over again with someone new; the ubiquity of problems… You would miss your partner; you have a lot of shared memories; there used to be (until quite recently) considerable hope. But they have hurt you badly and you them. There is a whole layer of scars created by the memory of impasses; of conversations that were not properly resolved, of areas in which neither of you could change to please the other. You're both slowly disappointing one another deeply - and it's soul-sapping to be a helpless observer of love ratcheting down. You don't know what to do. If only there was someone to speak to, a wise, kind person who would know how to cut through this. Then you realise that more than a solution, you really want someone who could understand how hard it is that there isn't one. Someone would say, I know, I know… Sometimes we don't need 'solutions.' We need sympathy for our impasses. We need to know that we're not idiots for having the challenges we have; that other sensible people have been here too; that it could almost be OK to have this difficulty forever. Maybe it's one of life's givens. That's when a bracing pessimistic philosophy is called for, the sort that says: Of course you're miserable, you're alive. Of course it's a mess, welcome to existence. Of course love is impossible, you're a human being. This isn't the first choice naturally. You wanted to sort this out impeccably. The way you sort out other things impeccably: at work, in domestic life. But this isn't a cupboard, or an accounting document. The number of people who have this area of life properly sorted out is miniscule, perhaps below 1%. You have failed here, that is for sure, but you are not exceptionally stupid for that. You're averagely mad, averagely emotionally perturbed - and you're trying to do something exceptionally extraordinarily dementedly hard. Poor you. And poor us."

    "Title": "Is Everyone Else Normal? Feeling Painfully Different",
    "Transcript": "Much is said about the virtues and pleasures of individuality - of being someone who stands out from the crowd and delights in their particularity. But let's also admit to how frankly lonely and frightening it can be to find ourselves (yet again) in a peculiar minority, where the differences between us and others strike us as bewildering rather than emboldening, when for example: Everyone wants to gossip but we prefer generosity and forgiveness. Everyone is at ease but we're melancholy and self-conscious. Everyone is cheerful but we can't let go of anxiety and apprehension. Everyone is confident but we feel suspicious and ashamed of ourselves. Everyone seems contented in their couples but we are still searching for a home. Everyone worries passionately about the future of the planet - but we feel cold and at times almost indifferent. Everyone seems to love life, but we're not sure we quite do. At such times, we might benefit from a few thoughts to alleviate the isolation: We don't know reality as well as we imagine. What we believe 'everyone' is like may not be how they really are. We may have more friends than we think. We are getting statistics wrong: these four or eight or twelve people in a room don't represent all of humanity. The 80 or so people in our social group are a miniscule part of the story. There are still so many friends left to meet. Perhaps our existing companions actually know much more about the material we feel alone with than we suspect; they, and we, simply haven't found a way to share our selves. Maybe they will feel what we feel one day - just not yet. It may be fine to belong to a minority. Minorities have sheltered some of the most accomplished spirits. Isolation may be a price we pay for a certain complexity of mind. We have art to bridge the gaps between ourselves and others. Bookshops are an ideal destination for the lonely, given how many books were written because their authors couldn't find anyone to talk to. Maybe there are people nearby - perhaps in this community - who would understand very well indeed."

    "Title": "How Repressed Emotions Make Us Sick",
    "Transcript": "The most curious and hazardous feature of the way we're built lies in the difficulty we have registering what we actually feel. Our vast and strange minds get filled with thoughts that go unsifted and with feelings we don't have the courage to look at. We might be angry or sad while lacking any active awareness that we are so. Or guilty or envious without any grasp of what is at play behind a thin psychological curtain. And we remain unconscious - always - because we are resistant to ideas that threaten our sense of calm, our self-image and our gratifying illusions about ourselves. We surely can't be angry because we're kind people who couldn't feel negatively about a beloved elderly relative. Or we can't be sad at not being invited to the party because we don't care about trivial, social matters. And it isn't possible that we are envious because we aren't people to covet others' advantages. While the greatest share of our mental apparatus privileges forgetting over understanding, we do - nevertheless - have a conscience. There's a part of us that wants the truth, however bitter it might be; a minor part, but a notoriously insistent and ingenious part that won't leave us in peace until its case has been heard. It will, in order to stir us from our reverie, give us all manner of problems - breakdowns, illnesses, twitches, compulsions - in the hope of letting us know that there is something we would benefit from reckoning with. When our conscience has done everything it can to alert our minds, it has a tendency to set to work on our bodies. More specifically, it forces us to feel in the form of a symptom what we haven't felt outright as an idea or insight. Lack of awareness returns to haunt us as physical ailments. If our intellect won't look at our anger, the feeling may be sent to dwell in our lower back. If our anxiety isn't being dealt with psychologically, it may be relegated to our gut. Romantic frustration that is denied may - literally - begin to wreck our hearts. Our unfelt feelings end up as back pain, constipation, insomnia, migraines and arrhythmias. However well-meaning, doctors seldom to know to ask the right questions. They picture themselves fixing material problems caused by material malfunctions, not that it might be an ex-partner who has broken our kidney or a stifled rage against our father that is freezing up our vertebrae. We need to do the work ourselves. In order to spare our bodies some of their mute agonies, we should submit them to a curious sounding exercise. With our eyes closed, probably while we are lying in bed, we should pass over our different organs and zones and ask: If this could speak, what might it want to tell us? What might the heart ask for, the legs, the shoulders, the stomach? Our minds are probably better able to think of answers than we presume. It could be surprisingly clear - once we ask the question - that our shoulders are desperate for the relationship to end; that our stomachs want us to take on less responsibility; that our hearts want a chance to say sorry; that our ribcage has had enough of pretending it is happy and that our lungs need an opportunity to scream. Many of our bodily ailments are ultimately mute forms of revenge for all the thoughts and feelings we have assiduously been refusing to entertain. We will feel so much better in our bodies once we have repatriated our concerns to our minds; once we have reversed the process of forgetting and dared to see and endure what we have been in flight from for too long."

    "Title": "Why We Think We Are Losers (But Actually Aren't)",
    "Transcript": "Some of us are continually haunted by a sense that we are losers. Acquaintances may speak well of us. Colleagues may praise us, but there is an inner critic inside who has a very different verdict: you are a piece of nonsense, you are laughable, you are repulsive. This critic is extremely assiduous and determined, they are a world champion of sorts. They'll get into an argument with our best friend to insist that no, despite what they think, we really are awful; they'll disregard the evidence of a promotion or surprise birthday party and keep returning to the same theme: you are repulsive. Why does this inner critic exist? Why are they so remorseless? If they are inaccurate, why do they go on as they do? To find an explanation, we have to go back in time. Let's posit the following scenario. Early on in our lives, those of us with a harsh inner critic are likely to have faced a very troubling situation: someone close to us - it might have been a mother or a father - didn't seem to especially like us: they were cold and forbidding, they often got angry, or they simply disappeared (and maybe married someone else in another country). Or else they fell into depression or became an alcoholic. Why did all this happen? This is the question that would have faced the younger version of us, though we forget this now. It's very hard for a child to deal with a vacuum of explanation. The mind has to try to find some way of accounting for things because otherwise the mystery threatens to be unbearable. Better some answer than a void. Unfortunately, the childish mind doesn't have an accurate grasp of adult psychology or the workings of the grown-up world. Nevertheless, it's an energetic and vibrant machine and eventually, it is likely to land on an explanation that feels very powerful - and that in time ceases to reveal that it is just a good guess rather than an iron truth. And that explanation runs as follows: the bad thing that has happened to me has done so because I am bad. Father has left home because I suck. Mother is screaming because I suck. My sibling died because I suck. It's almost certain - we hasten to add - that this is not the right answer to why things unfolded as they did. But that's not the point. This was the answer we landed upon and that felt most plausible. A child will prefer to think that it lives in a rationally ordered world where things happen for logical reasons - even if this means having to think that they are bad than to take on board the terrifying notion that things happen that are entirely unfair, entirely undeserved, and utterly reprehensible to the interests and hopes of a child. Better to insist that one sucks than to have to believe in an amoral chaotic senseless universe. It's easy from here to see how the child who decided that they suck - to be precise, who had to conclude that they sucked in order to make sense of an unbearable pain - then grows up into an adult who continues to maintain, in the face of any evidence to the contrary, that they are dreadful, that all good news about them is merely a cover for hatred, that everything nice is underserved and that they are, despite key bits of evidence to the contrary, a piece of excrement. The way to break out of this prison is to realise that we are made up of parts. The inner critic is not the whole of us, it is a part that was formed early on in response to a particular situation. We might now thank it, very politely, for its work, because - at an early stage - it did in fact do a very good job of making sense of life. At a cost, it was responsible - we might say - for getting us to the next stage, it tided us over, it was very clever (for a six year old). But at the same time, we can now afford to take our leave of this helpful but profoundly mistaken part. Thank you inner critic, we might say. You did something bold and you meant well. But now, you threaten to ruin what remains of the rest of my life. It's time to say goodbye to the critic and assess reality through a fairer, less biassed, less uninformed lens. We don't suck, something awful happened to us. We aren't bad, something bad happened to us that we tried to rationalise by blaming ourselves for it. We aren't awful people and we don't deserve an awful future; we just came from a very difficult place."

    "Title": "Why We Should Refuse to Get Into Arguments",
    "Transcript": "However deep our theoretical commitment to serenity, in the course of an average day, we are likely to encounter a number of extremely well-crafted invitations to lose our tempers badly. Our partner will press a well-flagged nuclear button related, let's imagine, to their views on our mother or our career choice. At work, a colleague may deliberately not answer a very simple question to which we urgently need an answer. A shop attendant may give us a bored, insolent shrug. Someone in the supermarket may falsely accuse us of standing in the wrong line. What we are apt to miss at such moments of blatant provocation, as we get swallowed up in fears of humiliation, illogicality and injustice, is just how much many people enjoy having arguments, indeed crave them in order to refind their equilibrium and appease their psychic discomforts. We are tricked into imagining that there may be genuine issues that require our wholehearted engagement but thereby lose sight of the true psychological motivations at play. A person is trying to get us into a fight not because they have a sincere complaint against us but because they are feeling overwhelmed by the intensity of their own aggression, which they hope to placate by spoiling a portion of our lives. By goading us into a battle, they are looking for a way to evacuate their fury into us, to use us as a receptacle for their emotional waste, to employ a skirmish with us to distract themselves from their own intractable conflicts and muted sorrows, to seduce us into joining them in their sadness and entanglements, so that they might feel less alone and less bereft. We should resist such enthusiastic and subtly crafted invitations by recognising them for what they are: attempts by the other party to rescue themselves from unbearable feelings. We might - if we are exceptionally generous - pity them for their despair; we don't in any way need to join them in their gladiatorial quests. What may at times provoke us to a particular pitch of excitement is a puzzlement as to why others are behaving as they are: why on earth - we wonder in a strangled way - have they once again mentioned something we implored them to leave alone, why are they being almost deliberately slow or rude or surly, why is someone who should be kind and thoughtful suddenly so off-hand and cruel. It's our wide-eyed quest for sensible answers that ends up fanning our upheaval. We should answer our bafflement with far greater simplicity and therapeutic rigour. There aren't any good reasons for the discord. It's just that our interlocutor is in a very bad way and has concluded - not incorrectly alas - that they may well feel significantly better once we have started to raise our voice, redden and call them horrible names we'll later regret with intensity. We should work out the clever game and refuse to play any further rounds of it; whether the invitee is our spouse, a stranger, our child or a colleague. We're not being kind by leaving them to it, we're not being pacific or eerily grown up. It's just there is so much else that needs our attention: we have to hold on to our thoughts, repair our wounds, appease our turmoils and discover our own routes to happiness. We must sidestep the many dragnets because we have so many other, truly more important things to do."

    "Title": "The Lengths We Go To Avoid Love",
    "Transcript": "The idea of trying to avoid love sounds paradoxical in the extreme: why would anyone take steps to deny themselves an experience which seems so plainly positive and life enhancing? Plenty of people are denied love by external forces; why would anyone take active measures to sabotage love if it lay before them? The answer can only be found by looking back in time. Though we all crave love in theory, our capacity to accept it in practice is critically dependent on the quality of our early emotional experiences. To abbreviate sharply, we can only willingly tolerate being loved if - as children - the process of loving and being loved felt sufficiently reliable, safe and kind. Some of us were not so blessed; some of us were stymied in our search for love in ways we have not yet recovered from or indeed fully understood. Perhaps the person we wanted to love fell ill or grew depressed. Or at the height of our dependence on them, they went away, or had a new family or turned their attention to a younger sibling. Or perhaps our parental figure was constantly at the office, or unavailable behind a locked study door. They might have had a violent unpredictable temper or left us somehow feeling that were never good enough for them. As a result, to an extent we may not even have realised, we became experts at independence. We came to associate safety with a high degree of self-protective isolation; we might have become big readers, or fascinated by the animal world, or obsessed with music or computer games. Without quite knowing we had done so, we learnt never to trust a flesh and blood three-dimensional human again. Our experiences may not have affected the strength of our longing for love; but they have heavily impacted our capacity to endure mutually satisfying relationships. We may now, as adults, tell ourselves that we want closeness and surrender. We will sob sincerely when we lose love, but we are continually taking steps to ensure we'll never be at any sustained risk of finding it. The true terror for us is not that love should fail but that it should by some oversight on our part succeed, for this would ask of us a level of defencelessness and exposure to another person and to a chance of happiness that has no precedent in our lives and poses immense, ego-shattering challenges to the armoured way our personalities have been structured. For the love-scared among us, we are constantly at work taking careful steps to ensure that any relationship we are in will flounder. We pick partners with an element of built-in obsolescence about them, some reason why in the end a relationship with them isn't going to be able to work out: people who just happen to be living on another continent, or who are married to someone else, or are impossibly distant to us in age. We beg for love from people who - as we know in our unconscious - are guaranteed not to want or be able to give it to us. We complain repeatedly that people we're involved with don't love us properly; the real worry is that they might. To ward off such an eventuality, we keep finding flaws: we'll point out that this one is often late, that one doesn't exercise enough, that one doesn't speak any foreign languages and this one isn't sufficiently creative, robustly determined to find any conceivable reason why - alas - no one quite suits our needs. If we find ourselves in a relationship, we'll assiduously practise the arts of what psychologists call 'distance management.' When the chance of reaching a truly happy state appears, we'll subtly discover ways to introduce a chasm: we'll have an argument, spoil a birthday, ruin a holiday. We'll find we have to do a lot of work for an upcoming exam or presentation, that our gang of friends need us to be somewhere else, that we 'forgot' to return the credit card or tax bill, that our appearance requires a lot of our attention or that we'd like to flirt with a stranger at a party who suddenly seems very attractive indeed: in both tiny and large ways, we'll know just how to lower the mood, scupper a bond and destroy trust, perhaps not enough to end a relationship completely, but enough to worry our partner sufficiently as to our solidity that we can be privately sure things will never truly fly. Friends may commiserate with us on our so-called 'bad luck.' Psychologists will note our superlative skill at romantic sabotage. Were this to sound like us, compassion is required. We should reflect back on our pasts and wonder at the connection between our fractured bonds with parental figures and our disrupted adult attachments. We aren't like this because we are wicked, we have just been very badly hurt. Once we understand how our skill at independence was acquired, we'll be in a better position to see that it has in reality outlived its rationale. We may still feel immensely apprehensive at the prospect of contentment but we may finally be able to admit that we are first and foremost acting out of fear. Rather than dismissing our partners, we may stick closer to a much more awkward truth: that we are tempted to draw away from them because we are immensely scared that they might finally be in a position to make us very happy - and that simply nothing so unutterably and boundlessly frightening has ever happened to us before."

    "Title": "Why Nice People Repel Us",
    "Transcript": "There are many things that might disrupt the mood of a promising early date: a sudden discovery of a maddening political opinion, a grating laugh, poor dental hygiene, an unfortunate choice of top. But there is a far more perplexing and, superficially at least, paradoxical kind of distaste that might abruptly arise. One might want to take leave of a companion - and even rush outdoors to vomit - not because they are crude, dim or nasty but because they have revealed themselves to be undeniably and conspicuously nice. Why might kindness be so hard to bear? Why should warmth prove - on occasion - comprehensively repulsive? Why might nausea descend in the face of emotional maturity? Because, through no fault of our own, our whole character may have been built up around the need to cope well with not being given what we want; with not finding intimate satisfaction, with not being the recipient of anyone's reliable kindness, with being foiled in our search for tenderness and sympathy. As people with an allergic response to warmheartedness, somewhere in our past, we are liable to have experienced severe letdown, against which we had to insulate ourselves with a plethora of clever defensive strategies. We learnt to always reject before we were rejected; we learnt not to get taken in by anyone's honeyed words, we firmly exchanged hope for cynicism and vulnerability for impregnability. No wonder then that a kind soul might come across as extremely threatening. The nausea we feel in their presence isn't so much disgust as fear; the fear that we may have to shed our defences in the name of trusting that life may not going forward have to be as cold, isolated, and frightening as it evidently once was. We hear so often of the difficulties of emotional misery; they may be as nothing next to the challenges of emotional contentment, the challenge of having to unclench our suspicions and give up on our reserves of fear and disdain. The real risk of dating isn't that our partners will be awful (there's no end of fun to be had turning minor disasters into dark wit), but that once in a while, they may be unblemished and sweet. Anyone can bear love that fails; it takes a very fortunate and secure childhood to countenance that it might in fact work out. It can be so tempting to accuse a kind candidate of something - to call them 'boring' or 'soppy' or to make an acid remark about their way of stepping through a door or asking for more ice. We should have sufficient insight into our own difficult trajectories to put a finger more accurately on the true sources of our discomfort: that these unfortunates are in danger of not making us suffer in the way we have grown up expecting that we will have to suffer in order to feel we are in love. We reject not out of meanness, but because we have had so little experience of kindness. The next time the ick of kindness descends, we might dare to turn it away in the name of starting out on what might turn out to be the greatest adventure of our lives: a belief in the possibility of contentment and closeness."

    "Title": "Why We Behave As We Do",
    "Transcript": "A key principle governing the natural world is that animals adapt to thrive in particular habitats; what we call an animal's character is essentially a set of traits that gives it maximal opportunity to flourish in specific circumstances. The owl is - for example - furtive and nocturnal to help it succeed in crowded habitats with heavy pressures on food supplies. Stick insects are docile and skilled at disappearing into a background of twigs and branches to help them avoid the attention of rodents and spiders. And African wild dogs are collaborative and respectful of hierarchies to lend them the very best chances of cornering impalas and springboks. We humans are - in the end, beneath a layer of civilisation - not so different. We too adapt our characters to suit our specific habitats, though what we mean by habitats are not corners of the jungle or grassland but rather our families of birth. Just like many animals, we arrive defenceless into highly distinctive circumstances to which we must adjust in order to thrive. In certain families, it will in short order become obvious - to the highly attuned psyche of a child - that success here requires that one keep a very low profile and never challenge the reigning figures of authority. In other habitats, the child will learn that it must constantly entertain everyone in order to be noticed while in others still, a child might surmise it needs to act up and get into certain forms of trouble to lay claim to a scarce supply of attention. This thesis can be helpful - and opens up avenues of compassion - when we encounter people whose behaviour is especially puzzling or maddening. Why does a certain person keep telling lies? Why does another person find it so hard to be emotionally warm? We may need to look for answers in the adaptive strategies required by the habitats of their birth: evasions from the truth might be vital when there is someone furious and intolerant in the house; just as emotional reserve may be a highly intelligent adaptive move when there is a care-giver who is emotionally erratic or absent. What makes life notoriously difficult for we humans, as for many animals, is that our habitats do not stand still. As the places we dwell in alter, so the traits that we originally developed to cope with them risk becoming either redundant or problematic. It might, for example, have made great sense to hone a shouty, aggressive manner in an early habitat populated by burly competitive siblings, but this manner may, in the context of an adult relationship or an office environment, give rise to severe malfunction and upset. Similarly, it may once have made total sense to develop a hypervigilant outlook - with constant panic, lightning responses to threats and round the clock alarm - when the habitat of birth contained an abusive and unboundaried parent. But what once guaranteed safety may now destroy any chances of the peaceful and settled adult existence one craves and deserves. The history of animal species is filled with melancholy examples of failures to adapt to new circumstances. To be a light speckled moth was wholly strategic before the Industrial Revolution - and a ticket to evolutionary disaster thereafter. It was once brilliant for a German Shepherd to try to bite most things that came its way - and a route to ostracism and extinction once it had to dwell in tightly-packed cities filled with young children. We may ourselves - without realising it - be behaving in ways that only ever really assisted us in the very specific habitat of our birth. Our closed characters, our deceitfulness, our manic joy or round-the-clock fear may be legacies of habitats we left behind decades ago. Our angry father or manipulative mother, our jealous siblings or moralistic caregiver are no longer here - while the traits we needed to cope with them endure and continuously marr our relationships and our careers. It may be time to say farewell to much in our characters that was only ever a clever and creative strategy for survival in a narrow world that no longer exists."

    "Transcript": "what happens to a child who isn't loved properly the answer one might expect is that they start to hate the person who doesn't give them the love they need but far from it the reality is that the child becomes filled with shame a sense that it's profoundly unworthy dirty soiled sinful ugly embarrassing the child is unable to redirect the blame outwards it doesn't ask what's wrong with my parents for not loving me adequately it simply wonders in a foror way what have I done wrong in order to have ended up on the receiving end of my parents disapproval the child prefers to attack itself for being bad than to confront a yet more awful possibility that it's entirely dependent for its well-being on inadequate and unkind parental figures the child searches for explanations for the lack of love it has to endure and comes up with all the wrong ANS answers it concludes I've not been impressive enough and therefore it undertakes enormous efforts to prove to itself and Outsiders that it does nevertheless deserve to exist at school this kind of child might try seven times as hard as any other to show that it's clever and good or else a child may go down an antisocial route and graffiti the nearby underpass as a desperate way of giving outward form to a feeling of Badness it's tortured by inside there is so sadly no way out from the burden of Shame available either by trying to be extremely good or extremely bad the only solution is to work against the grain of forgetting in order to perceive for the first time an awful possibility that one could never perceive as a child that one has done nothing wrong at all that wrong was done to one"

    "Title": "The Conditions of Love",
    "Transcript": "When looking at the odder aspects of other people's and our own behaviour, there is one simple-sounding question we should always keep close to the front of our minds: what did you need to do in your family of origin in order to get noticed, cared for and loved? What conditions of love did you grow up with - and might you still, by extension, unconsciously therefore be operating under (for it can take our deep minds a very long time indeed to recognise that they are no longer subject to a parental aegis)? What someone devotes extraordinary energy too now is likely to be an adult version of more or less what they once had to do to secure the affection we all need not to perish as infants. There are parents who demand that their offspring succeed; and just as often - but more covertly - parents who require them to fail. There are parents who need their children to look conspicuously attractive and others, tragically, who are sexually so uncontained that their children are incentivised to put on weight or damage their bodies in order to repel the danger of incestuous advances The questions - what conditions of love did you grow up under? What did you need to do to get noticed? - are, as we can see, of particular use when we try to assess behaviours that - from the angle of our flourishing - make no sense at all. Why does someone exhaust themselves earning gargantuan sums of money they can never spend? Why would someone blow up one relationship after another? Why would someone be sexually seductive with everyone they encounter? Why can someone never find a way to be serious or appropriately authentic? The answers always lie in the secret complex bargains that certain families have made with their offspring: impress the world or I will ignore you, stay loyal to me or I won't be able to endure my loneliness, accept my sexual advances or be denied my care, protect me from my depression or I may end up taking my life. These melancholy analyses open up the way to a liberation from our patterns. Once we can see that we are only in effect continuing to do what was once forced out of us in order to exist, we will also be in a position to break free from our manacles. We will be able to feel sadness for our younger selves but also recognise that that we are no longer operating under the narrow strictures of the early years; we can seek out attention and care for what is in line with our true needs. The privilege of adulthood is to be able to find our way to our own, less distorted and less cruel conditions of love."

    "Title": "5 Questions to Ask Yourself Every Evening",
    "Transcript": "our minds are some of the busiest places in the known universe it's estimated that under a deceptively calm exterior some 70,000 separate thoughts hurry through Consciousness from the moment we wake up to the time we slip into sleep what many of these thoughts have in common is that we seldom do them any kind of Justice the result is a kind of sensory overload and an immense difficulty processing what we've actually been through we don't have time to feel the anger we're beset by we don't have the wherewithal to give room to the sadness that nags at us we can't on too many occasions properly think our own thoughts or feel our own feelings but these thoughts and feelings do need to be understood and will protest more or less actively when they're not anger that hasn't been given its due will emerge as irritability grief that hasn't been honored will metas into aimlessness and despair what we call mental illnesses are usually the outcome of periods of Our Lives that we haven't had the strength or opportunity toand or mourn what can help our troubles is self-exploration and that's why we've produced five questions that we suggest can be rehearsed every evening on a regular basis and will help to appease the sources of our troubles first question what am I really worried about this question recognizes something rather unusual about how we operate we frequently don't stop to ask ourselves what we're truly worried about this sounds odd surely if we're worried we would be expected to pause rather quickly and explore why but our minds seem not to work in this supremely logical sounding way they feel anxious long before they're ever motivated to ask themselves why they might be so they can carry on for months even years under the fog of diffuse concern before setting themselves the challenge of zeroing in on what is really at stake so the question bids us to stop running and to turn around and look at what might actually be ailing us the use of the word really is strategic we often use one worry to Shield us from another we worry about an upcoming interview to protect us from worrying about the state of our relationship we worry about money in order not to worry about death so it can be helpful to keep a supplementary inquiry in mind what worry might lie behind the worry that is currently obsessing me second question what am I presently sad about we can make a generalization we go around being far braver than is good for us because we need to get on with the practicalities of the day we frequently push to the side all the slights hurts disappointments and griefs that flow through our River of Consciousness we choose not to notice how vulnerable we are for fear that we cannot afford our own sensitivity but stoicism and strength carry their own dangers with the help of this question we should give time to noticing that despite our competent and strong exteriors lots of smaller and larger things have managed to hurt us today like every day perhaps someone didn't laugh when we told a joke our partner has been a little distant of late a friend didn't call a senior figure at work was less than completely impressed we don't need to mock ourselves we aren't weaklings for being fragile in fact there is no clearer evidence of our maturity than our capacity to explore the ways in which we like everyone else on the planet are as sensitive and easily bruised as a child third question who has annoyed me and how we want to be polite of course we're attached to the Norms of civilization it upsets us to think we might be upset nevertheless here too we need to have the courage of our actual sensitivity no day goes by without someone annoying Us in some rather fundamental way usually without them in any way meaning to our spirits will be lighter if we can bring ourselves to spell out the injury what happened how did it make us feel what might we tell ourselves to refind equilibrium if we were lucky we used to do this sort of thing with a kindly parent when we returned home from school now as careful Guardians to ourselves we can internalize the process and use our inner adult to soothe the always easily flustered but also easily calmed inner child fourth question what does my body want much of what we feel but don't process has a habit of ending up in our bodies that's why we develop back ache tense shoulders knotted stomachs and fluttery hearts in order to live more easily around our bodies we should regularly drain them of the emotions that they have unfairly been burdened with we should mentally scan our bodies from top to toe and ask ourselves what each organ might require what do my shoulders want to tell me what would my stomach want to say what does my back need what do my legs crave the questions may sound strange what is surprising is that we're likely to have some very concrete answers just waiting for us when we ask fifth question what is still lovely despite so much that's difficult every day brings us up against a range of things that still delight and enchant us often these elements are small the light on the kitchen wall in the morning a child holding its parents hand at the bus stop a fig we had at lunchtime these might not sound like things we should bother to register but summoned up in their full richness and held in our attention for a few moments they can help to fortify us against the voices of Despair we tend to assume that if something is lovely it will strike our minds as being so with full force without us needing to do anything supplementary the reality is stranger we need to make a conscious effort to squeeze joy out of beneficial elements that might otherwise be forgotten without notice our lives have some lovely aspects to them but we may surprisingly regularly and rather clumsily have to make a list of them in order to realize that they exist when Socrates apparently the wisest man of antiquity was asked to Define our highest purpose as human beings he offered a still legendary answer to know ourselves we should aspire to be people who never see to try to make sense of themselves at the close of every day we should devote ourselves constantly to trying to shrink the scale of the darkness within us bringing what was once in Shadow closer to the light of interpretation so that we stand a chance of becoming slightly less frantic and rather more joyful creative and calm creatures"

    "Title": "The True Cause of Obsessive Thinking",
    "Transcript": "For some of us, today like every day, will mean another case of immersing ourselves, from the moment we wake up, in a by-now very familiar set of painful thoughts. We will dwell - once again - on how awful we look and more particularly, on how our nose is repulsively proportioned relative to the rest of our face. We will think - once again - of a website we inadvertently visited twelve years ago and how the police might be preparing to close in on, and arrest, us. We will think - once again - of how several of our neighbours (especially the people upstairs) might be colluding to ruin and disgrace us. Or we will think - once again - of something we said to a colleague which we fear they misconstrued and which may well lead them to seek disciplinary action against us at any moment. These thoughts may ostensibly be about a variety of topics but beneath the surface, they have two key features in common: they are about something appalling we feel we are or have done. Or they are about something appalling we fear that others are about to do to us. We are the victims of one of the cruellest and most remorseless of all mental afflictions: obsessive thinking. Crucially, obsessive thinking is not - despite the linguistic proximity - to be confused with thinking per se. It certainly looks, on the surface, as though the obsessive thinker is thinking a lot. All day, they might be drawing up dense charts and jotting down intricate matters in a notebook. They might want to leave a party early or escape family life in order to go to their room to 'think.' They might have become near world experts in plastic surgery or police surveillance techniques or an area of employment law. They would be able to tell you everything about tracking devices, post operative skin treatments and the minute by minute developments in a specific aspect of the media agenda. Their cogitation may be extreme but we may still want to resist calling any of this thinking. As obsessive thinkers, we are not making progress though anything of note, we're not advancing through a dilemma; we're not clearing up a priority. We are thinking in order not to think. By which is meant, we are using one kind of thought to ward off another. We are employing obsessive thinking as a defence against thinking more laterally and emotionally about who we are and what has happened to us; against knowing ourselves properly. To try to break the agonising loops in our minds, we might try to ask ourselves a deceptively simple-sounding question: if we could not think about our chosen topic, if we were to be debarred from returning to our favoured theme, what might we think about? What other thoughts might lie behind or to the side of our entrenched ritualised preoccupations? Our minds are unlikely to yield a neat answer. But we can hazard a generalisation: if we could not think about our obsessive topic, we would most likely to need in one way or another to feel intensely, overwhelmingly sad, lonely, desperate or bereft. Behind the monomaniacal thoughts about cameras or data packets or legal processes or social media, there is almost always an extremely frightened, isolated, unloved child who long ago could not bear to inhabit their own experience. Obsessive patterns of thinking have gripped themselves remorselessly to the walls of the mind in order to prevent a tragic re-encounter with an early, highly vulnerable and hurt version of oneself. In a bid for relief, we should dare - for once - to risk not returning to our usual themes and instead, while conceding that this is what we might be doing, to stop running. We should pause where we are and leave our secondary thoughts time to catch up with us. We should put down our fixations and let the waves of our background grief and fear wash over us. However tightly we have associated our problems with our favoured topic of scrutiny, there has almost certainly long been something bigger, older and more tragic that we have been unable to look at: that we were maltreated by a caregiver, that our parents chronically preferred a sibling to us, that a father humiliated us repeatedly to overcome his shame at his own sexual abuse. We have at an unconscious level made a desperate choice to think ill of ourselves or to worry about plots against us in order to impose a degree of logic on an otherwise impossibly confounding early experience of neglect or betrayal: to an indigestible experience of untrustworthiness, to a failure of love. Our minds may gradually have an opportunity to grow less consumed by obsessive thoughts the more we can interpret our preoccupations as symptoms of other concerns we are in flight from; the more we can give up our feelings of persecution, unacceptability and guilt in favour of a sadder, slower older truth about ourselves: that we were very badly let down indeed."

    "Title": "2 Unexpected Ways to Stop Sabotaging Yourself",
    "Transcript": "There's an enlightening and sometimes slightly painful exercise one can do by oneself to learn a bit more about the origins of how one feels and behaves. Pick out something emotional that you know you're not very good at now - and write it down on a sheet of paper. Here are some examples: - Staying Calm - Taking Pride in yourself - Trusting - Missing people who go away We often observe these traits in ourselves with a mixture of puzzlement and embarrassment. Why are we like this? Why can't we be more normal? What's up with us? To find a way to some answers, continue to the second part of the exercise. Insert the above entries into the following sentence: How safe would it have been for you to do this [insert sentence] in your childhood? ie. Staying Calm, Taking Pride in yourself etc. Now try to reflect on WHY it might have been unsafe to do or feel a certain way in the past: - It didn't feel safe to feel calm because... someone was drinking heavily in the house - it didn't feel safe to take pride in oneself because... someone was obsessively jealous - It didn't feel safe to trust because... someone was cruel or unreliable - It didn't feel safe to miss people who were absent because... the pain would have broken one's heart. Notice that in all cases, what in later life becomes a problem starts off by being a very clever protective strategy. We are more mysterious to ourselves than we should be when we fail to see that much of what we do that looks odd or unusual in adult life is really a relic of a protective strategy that made a lot of sense in childhood. The point of waking up to the origins of a protective strategy is that we can then learn to see that it isn't necessary to hold on to it any longer. There is no reason to fail at work in order to avoid the spectre of jealousy. We can afford to miss people when they go - they'll be back and we can dare to feel and love. We need not continue our loyalty to our past protective strategies once we understood the particular circumstances that once made them so necessary - and that now no longer apply."

    "Title": "6 Historical Hangovers Making Us Miserable Today",
    "Transcript": "When trying to understand why we might be feeling unhappy, we tend to be drawn to reasons relatively close to home: it might have to do with friends, relationships, health, jobs, families or schedules. What we tend not to do, however, is to start talking about our place in history; it would sound overblown or plain bizarre to begin to pin a sizeable share of our difficulties to broad historical and sociological forces. Yet whatever role our psyches and our families and colleagues might be playing in our moods, a proper understanding of our situation cannot be complete without consideration of the highly peculiar and novel era in which we exist. We are troubled in part because we dwell in highly unbalanced times: Transcendence At the centre of all premodern societies were powers that helped to put humans in their place: older, bigger, stronger, holier phenomena, perhaps a god, a natural energy or a spirit. However important humans might have felt, however grand the aristocracy or urgent the news of the day, people knew that they were not the measure of all things, that above and beyond the earthly realm, there was something else - more mysterious, imposing and strange - to which they would all regularly have to bow and which would relativise them in one another eyes. The fanciest king was nothing next to a thunderous god; the mightiest invention pathetic next to an angry sea. But we humans are now the most astonishing things we can conceive of: it's our momentous doings, our intelligence, our incomprehensibly wondrous technologies that mesmerise us and are at the centre of collective consciousness. God has died and nature is to be pitied and patronised like a wounded once-proud animal. We have lost any redeeming sense of our own unimportance. Expectations We are at the same time - each one of us - told that repeatedly that we could do and be anything. We might - with sufficient hard work - assume the presidency, unlock a major scientific secret or become known to the entire planet through our athletic or artistic prowess. We are also thereby subtly informed that only a very special destiny is valid. There is no dignity left in a so-called ordinary life, there can be nothing to celebrate in an unheralded, unknown existence. We cannot live quietly and be in bed by nine. We must become someone - or else look on with envy and rage at those who have evaded the perils of mediocrity. Media We used to know almost nothing of what happened beyond our own valley or shoreline. Life went by so slowly that we were often - without appreciating how much this kept us sane - a little bored. Now no bloodshed, scandal, upset or peril can occur anywhere on the planet without us hearing of it in minutes - and we are as a result in a state of continuous unrest and alarm, unable to set anything negative in context, unsure of how to evaluate our species, terrified to trust or speak to a stranger, constantly feeling that we are leading the wrong lives. We know everything - except the less perceptible things that really matter. Our attention is drawn only to our discords, our spitefulness and our cruelty. We have been stripped of opportunities to contemplate older, slower currents, to draw inspiration from dawn, the murmurings of doves or robins or the barks of ancient trees that speak of time measured in centuries. Isolation We have been sold the idea that the one solution to our loneliness lies in Romantic love. We therefore search with frantic abandon in the lonely concrete canyons of our modern megalopolises for one very special being who can be everything to us: best friend, sexual partner, playmate, kindergarten teacher, cook, chauffeur etc. And then, when (inevitably) we cannot find them, we perceive ourselves as having been uniquely cursed. We misunderstand the generality of the problem - and miss the solace available in the less febrile and prestigious realm of friendship; in distributing our needs more equitably among a whole community, none of whose members need to answer to the whole of anyone's longings. We've been rendered exceptionally lonely by the unwittingly cruel notion of a soulmate. Work We could - back then - stand away from our work and see something substantial and solid that we had made: a chair, some horseshoes, a house. We now occupy ourselves on tasks that have been infinitely subdivided and thereby lost much of their wider logic. We carry professional titles like logistics controller, automation specialist or human resource manager that show us up as minute cogs in endlessly complicated engines. We may be richer than ever; we struggle to see what difference we could possibly make to anyone else's life. Self-Discipline All the while, we lose ourselves in temptations which our evolutionary past leaves us defenceless against. Because we were programmed to eat any sugary thing - a rare blackberry or apricot - that came our way, we now cannot resist the plethora of satanic confections on offer on every street corner. Because in our old villages we might have seen one or two fertile people a day, we now can't stop looking at ceaseless digital processions of the unclothed. We have no willpower to resist the pitiless delights of the modern world. It is hard to reverse any of the pressures we have been placed under. But even if we cannot, knowing that these exist helps us to locate with greater fairness the origins of many of our troubles. We are not uniquely or personally awful, frantic, greedy or degenerate. We are under historically exceptional pressures. To know ourselves properly is to honour how much of our madness does not belong simply to us."

    "Title": "Our Secret Wish Never to Find Love",
    "Transcript": "The process of locating a partner to love is famously so hard, it may for a long time disguise an alternative, even more complicated reality: that whatever we claim, it would be a lot easier for us if we never found them. The hurdles of dating undeniably exist; that doesn't mean that they aren't also being gratefully used to hide - mostly from ourselves - a harder-to-mention wish to remain on our own. Consciously, we may tell ourselves that we would dearly love to land on a compatible soul. Inside, we are hard at work ensuring we won't - and for a variety of hugely understandable reasons: - because it is simply too painful to hope. - because we have realised that we have too much talent for identifying characters who can torment us. - because we have had enough of other people's madness and too much experience of our own; because humans may be best enjoyed from a distance. - because recovery from a love that promised a future robs us of too many of our remaining years. - because we have understood - finally - how properly difficult we are to live with. - because no one is as perfect or as docile as the many attractive strangers we will never speak to. - because longing alone can be so much more gratifying than a scratchy day-to-day reality together. - because if we never love, we cannot be hurt. - because there has to be a limit to how many times we can be expected to take off our clothes in front of a stranger. - because we didn't have the sort of childhood to develop the right instincts for this game. But, as these are difficult thoughts to own up to, to ourselves and our friends, we may prefer to disguise our true intentions behind a choreography of well-designed failures. Love would have been delightful, it was just that: - We chose people who we knew would be busy. - We failed to call back those who were keen. - We left the party before most people arrived. - They're all 'boring' or 'unattractive.' - We disappointed others before they stood any chance of disappointing us. As a result, we can continue to experience with security one of the most risk-free of all beliefs: that we would love to love, if only we found the right person... We may be denied a partner, but we can hold on to something yet more precious: a sense of safety, and a sure belief that the appropriate candidate would, if they arrived, be capable of solving our suffering. There may be few stronger Romantics than those who manage carefully - and sometimes perhaps even wisely - to steer clear of anyone to be Romantic with."

    "Title": "What Is It to Be Emotionally Mature: Part Two",
    "Transcript": "Emotional maturity is a state few of us ever reach - or at least not for very long. But it may help us to try to lay out what some of the ingredients are so that we have an idea what we might aim for: If we were to grow into emotionally mature people, this is some of what we would have learnt how to be: - We would strive to understand the specific ways in which our childhoods had made us crazy. We would accept that most of what we are is shaped by relatively small events that unfold before we are ten. We would find a good therapist. - We would notice the patterns. Perhaps we wouldn't need to keep trying to impress older figures of authority; or to fall in love with distant people who were involved with someone else. We would acquire a (low-resolution) map of our neuroses. - There would be a little more delay between feeling something and having to act on it. We might even at times simply observe a feeling and do nothing. - We could bear to listen. We would no longer cut across and say, 'That reminds me of something…' just as another person started to share their story. We would soothe our own wounded egos into silence, look warmly into their eyes and say, 'Tell me more, this sounds so interesting…' - Fewer people would strike us as being either very good or very bad; we would sense the struggle in everyone to keep afloat. We would judge that we were all a mixture of the good-hearted and the egoistic. We would have less of an impulse to stone wrongdoers. - We would take measures to stay pessimistic about how things turn out; we would remind ourselves on an hourly basis that all relationships are riven with pain, all business ventures are maddening, and all families are demented. We wouldn't feel so persecuted; this is how things universally are (it's just that other people carefully omit to speak about it). We would get less hopeful and - therefore - less bitter and less furious. Of course, things are often slightly disastrous, of course, we have made some terrible mistakes, of course, we have been betrayed and treated badly. It would all feel eminently and supremely normal. - We would cease lamenting our wrong turns: we probably did marry the wrong person; we almost certainly did choose the wrong career. Probably we are living in the wrong country (and definitely the wrong house). We invested in useless things. We befriended unworthy sorts, we made awful errors bringing up our children, we neglected our health. We would be starting to get it right if we lived to a 1,000 or could do half a dozen practice runs. - We would realise that there is no manual on how to live. Everyone is making it up as they go along. No one is normal, and no one understands more than bit of anything. - We would marvel at the passage of the years. Growing old: what a strange thing to happen to a little boy or girl. - We would have been through a sufficient number of summers and winters to know that things do pass, eventually. What looks at one time like a mountain will - over the years - be worn down to a pebble. Some of our greatest losses wouldn't even register anymore. What we are weeping about today may make no sense a while from now. They say you'll get over it - and you will. - We would laugh more richly because we had capitulated to the darkest truths. This is some of what we might think and feel if we ever became those paragons of true intelligence: emotionally mature people."

Our greatest ambition would be to reach a heightened understanding of our own minds. - We would constantly be aware of not being able to complete more than a fraction of this elevated goal and would hence be deeply cautious in all our assertions and conclusions. 'Sorry', 'perhaps' and 'maybe' would be some of our favourite words. - We would recognise what unfaithful allies our conscious minds are for the project of self-discovery; how much of us wants to know ourselves and how very much more doesn't want to in the least. We would be humbled by the strength of our inclinations to distraction and denial. - We would properly realise that we were going to die and would put this terrifying thought to use on a daily basis to nudge us towards greater appreciation, authenticity and focus. It would help us to say, at points, and at last, 'no.' - We would realise, with considerable dark humour, that we were fools. We are idiots now, we were idiots then and we will be idiots tomorrow. There are few other options for a human being. - We would shed our pride; we would realise how much we constantly misunderstand - and never more so than when we begin to have faith in our competence and sanity. - We would acknowledge the influence of the body on the mind. We may sink into existential despair not because there is anything objectively tragic at hand, but because we are in urgent need of an orange juice or missed out on an hour of sleep. - We would respect the art of diplomacy and the importance of politeness; we would acknowledge the surprising thought that other people may be just as easily hurt as we are. - We would learn, painfully, to use language to give those around us an indication of what is at play within us. We wouldn't hold it against them that they didn't understand things we had never bothered to teach them. - We would realise how much others long for warmth and reassurance and would be less inhibited about offering those two very serious categories of gifts: cosiness and sweetness. - We would acknowledge that it was impossible to be friends with, or liked by, everyone. Attempting to please universally ultimately only leads to offending many; we would know how to disappoint frankly and quickly to avoid drawn-out appeasement. - We would feel more carefree at the idea of being strange. Public opinion would matter less, because we would have seen enough of the shallowness and reflex moralism of crowds. This would be our one life, we would know; and we would have the courage to be oddballs where we needed to be. - We would take our own boredom as a guide. Everyone else might declare it a brilliant book or an extraordinary play. We might toss it aside or walk out. This is some of what we might think and feel if we ever became those paragons of true intelligence: emotionally mature people."

And they countered - at first politely and then with great irritation - that even though A, you think B and that's why C is maddening to them. Both of you tried - pretty valiantly - to get your points across with calm and kindness. Both of you managed to be more or less polite, more or less restrained, more or less grown up. And by the end of the two hour conversation, you parted in an almost affectionate way and went to sleep in different rooms. But it's not enough and you know it. That's why you're up at 3am hearing the rain fall. You're pursued by questions: what do you keep doing wrong in love? Do you even belong together with this obviously very nice person? Why is it so hard? You briefly wonder what it would be like to leave. You picture some new dates. But the picture soon curdles; the horror of starting all over again with someone new; the ubiquity of problems… You would miss your partner; you have a lot of shared memories; there used to be (until quite recently) considerable hope. You don't know what to do. If only there was someone to speak to, a wise, kind person who would know how to cut through this. Then you realise that more than a solution, you really want someone who could understand how hard it is that there isn't one. Someone would say, I know, I know… Sometimes we don't need 'solutions.' We need sympathy for our impasses. We need to know that we're not idiots for having the challenges we have; that other sensible people have been here too; that it could almost be OK to have this difficulty forever. Maybe it's one of life's givens. That's when a bracing pessimistic philosophy is called for, the sort that says: Of course you're miserable, you're alive. Of course it's a mess, welcome to existence. Of course love is impossible, you're a human being. This isn't the first choice naturally. You wanted to sort this out impeccably. The way you sort out other things impeccably: at work, in domestic life. But this isn't a cupboard, or an accounting document. The number of people who have this area of life properly sorted out is miniscule, perhaps below 1%. You have failed here, that is for sure, but you are not exceptionally stupid for that. You're averagely mad, averagely emotionally perturbed - and you're trying to do something exceptionally extraordinarily dementedly hard. Poor you. And poor us."

    "Title": "Remember That EVERYONE Is Lonely",
    "Transcript": "One of the reasons why we tend not to make friends as often as we might comes down to a powerful background idea whose full destructive force we may not even be aware of: the belief that any decent person already has all the friends they need. Somewhere in our minds, the notion has been lodged that only very sad and inept people would - at this stage in their lives (and by this is simply meant whatever stage one happens to be at) - still have a space in their social agenda for a new entrant. Everyone else - anyone worth knowing, anyone talented, interesting and good - would long ago have acquired the gang to which they were now continuously and irredeemably wedded. What this punishing idea misses is the extent to which a feeling of loneliness and disenchantment with current company is in reality an ongoing and universal possibility, in no way limited to those of reduced appeal and capacities. Right now, the enchanting actor is (despite the crowds) lonely; as is the feted concert pianist, the renown biologist, the skilled airline pilot, the miraculous neurosurgeon and that rather nice looking person you have just spotted in the corner of the room laughing animatedly with a group of fashionable companions. It's open to anyone of sensitivity and charm to fail to find the right sort of allies, to have outgrown their friends from school or university, to not have landed on congenial spirits at work or in the sports centre and to be spending a lot of evenings on their own, either physically or spiritually. And we can know this for certain of other people because we know it, first and foremost, from a very reliable source: ourselves. We need to battle the fatefully modest part of our minds that reads our isolation as a selective punishment and vanquish it with a crucial bit of evidence available directly from our own experience. Other people who know us at a social level almost certainly find it hard to imagine the degree to which we are exposed to loneliness and how much we'd still like to locate a wise, tender, funny and interesting new friend - and it's statistically entirely improbable that we would be outliers in this respect. What holds true for us must and will hold true for others. We have built a predominantly cold and guarded society by falsely imagining a thesis which we implicitly know to be untrue on the basis of our own experience. We have allowed a species of self-hatred and shame to cloud our judgement and reduce to the status of a personal curse what is in fact a universal affliction and possibility. The next time we spot an interesting person, we should to stop contravening the moral of our own lives. We don't have exactly the right people in our circle - and nor, most probably, do they. We can afford to shed our false background thesis of social existence - and go and say hello."

    "Title": "Are you a Sadist or a Masochist  - and Why?",
    "Transcript": "Two of the strangest but most powerful concepts in psychology are sadism and masochism. By sadism is understood an enjoyment in causing others suffering. And by masochism, an enjoyment in receiving ill-treatment from others. Though commonly associated with sexual scenarios, these drives operate in all areas of life: at the office or in the school yard as much as in the bedroom or the dungeon. So why do they exist? Why do we seem to delight in inflicting suffering or, even more strangely, to take satisfaction in enduring it? The best way to understand the phenomena is to view them as attempts to deal with an earlier intolerable experience of fear, cruelty or unkindness. Before anyone winds up either a sadist or a masochist, they have first been a victim. Subsequent behaviours are a reflection of the mind's concerted attempts to find a way out of a naked encounter with pain. Masochists and sadists are both trying to ensure that they will survive what once felt like it might annihilate them. The sadist hits on the more straightforward move. Having received cruelty, they conclude that the best way to escape its shadow is to be cruel to somebody else. The poison is redirected outwards. The former terrified child becomes a terrifying adult. Implicitly, the sadist believes that there are only two roles available - victim or perpetrator - and that their best chances of never again ending up as the former is to ensure that they are always the latter. Masochists have - like sadists - also been the victims of cruelty. Like sadists, they are also in flight from defencelessness. But their method of adaption is more roundabout. A sense of weakness, real or imagined, holds them back from attempts to persecute others. And yet they still need some psychological way of alleviating the memory of suffering - and so hit upon what could almost be labelled an ingenious idea. They decide that they will henceforth choose suffering rather than have it forced on them; they opt to turn a necessity into something akin to a choice. Once they had no option but to be bullied by their family of birth; now they go out in active search of mean-minded partners whom they can unconsciously tell will deny them tenderness and care. Once they were told by others that they were a failure; now they ruin their chances before anyone else has the opportunity to do it for them. To liberate ourselves, we need to find our way back to the pain that lies behind our behaviours. And then we should do something we have until now avoided: mourn what we have gone through. We should exchange pain for sorrow. We should cry for what we have had to endure, not ask anyone else - it might be a stranger or, as regrettably, ourselves - to suffer any further."

    "Title": "How To Cope with an Imperfect Partner",
    "Transcript": "One of the stranger but more powerful discoveries of psychotherapy is that the average baby firmly believes it has two mothers. Mother 1 is kind, she comes when it calls, she gives it milk as soon as it needs it, she's sweet-natured and generous, wondrous and eminently deserving of love. But then there's another Mother, a far more challenging and terrifying proposition whom we can call Mother 2: and she sometimes doesn't give baby milk exactly what it wants when it wants it, she occasionally fails to interpret its needs, she can misjudge the temperature of the water at bath time, she has friends who come around and distract her and a phone that rings; she gets it wrong. Babies are creatures of intense emotion. To Mother 1, the baby directs deep and boundless love. To Mother 2, it gives pure and unalloyed hate. It wants to scream, chew her up and put her in the bin forever and ever. With time - and by now the baby might be a toddler - a shocking realisation is made. Despite evidence to the contrary, it emerges that Mothers 1 and 2 are in fact the very same person; the mother who can at one moment be completely delightful and gratifying is - it appears - the same mother who at another moment is profoundly enraging and enervating. This definitely isn't common sense and it takes a good long while to digest such a sobering notion. Indeed, it's such a wounding and complicated thought, psychotherapy tells us that many of us don't manage to accept it properly until late on in adulthood, after we've caused ourselves and others a lot of pain. For years, we can be inveterate dividers. Like babies, we also decide that good and bad, pleasing and frustrating, cannot exist within the heart of a single person. In the early days of a relationship, we are certain that we've met Lover 1: a delightful being who tells us kind things on our initial dates, someone with whom we go to Venice, who understands us completely, whom we want to marry and set up home with. But then, somewhere along the way, this person seems to give birth to a body double, someone with their exact height and width, with the same eyes and hairstyle, who occasionally sneaks into the room while we're not looking and whom we might term Lover 2 - and this person is a much less enchanting soul. They leave their wet towel on the bathroom floor, they have three annoying friends, they don't respect our hobbies, they say 'really' a bit too often. For a while, just like an enraged baby, we decide that the best place for Lover 2 is at the bottom of the bin - which will mean letting go of their twin as well. But on the way to telling them it's over, we may be struck by a more nuanced, ambivalent yet ultimately liveable idea: that Lovers 1 and 2 are, in spite of all the signs to the contrary, the same person under the influence of different moods and circumstances, that good and bad stand in a complex relationship within anyone and that - in violation of all our previous suppositions - perfect people do not exist. It's a sad thought in many ways, a tragic one even - and we may kick against it for an understandably long time, hopping from partner to partner while we do so. But eventually, we may learn to apply to other people the same degree of pessimistic generosity we give ourselves: we allow them to be - though we dearly wish they weren't - sometimes as wicked, flawed, disappointing and silly as we know we are. We can eventually recognise that there is something yet more important than finding a lover who never lets us down: a lover who exists; a lover who is real."

    "Title": "A Guide to Self Transformation",
    "Transcript": "One of the strangest and most tantalising ideas in psychotherapy is that of the 'repetition compulsion.' This tells us that, as a result of certain traumas that have not been properly understood and unpicked, we will be inclined to keep putting ourselves back into, and in effect re-enacting, difficult situations from the past that run counter to our emotional needs in the present. For example, we may be tempted to keep falling in love with people who make us suffer by being distant or cold, muddled or chaotic. Or we might constantly wind up in jobs where we try to please a tricky boss but are rejected by them and eventually dismissed. But there's a nuance here. We are not simply hunting out an awful situation and then attempting to repeat the whole of it. We are trying to find a story familiar enough for us to be drawn to it, and then we are attempting to give it a different ending. For example, we want to find someone who is as distant as our mother was but this time, we want to take her kind to therapy, have long dialogues with her, help her to see her wounds and act as her protector and her guide. We want to find the same sort of angry man who our father was but this time, rather than cowering under the sofa, we want a chance to be able to get to the root of their rage, appease it and ensure they treat us well. We are seeking, in adulthood, for a second chance to rectify a traumatic dynamic that our unavoidable childhood weaknesses meant we were never originally able to fix. What does it mean to give a story a better ending? It means bringing all the resources of adulthood to bear on the difficulties in an emotionally compromised childhood. This idea of story completion lends us a more hopeful angle to the concept of repeating the past. We aren't merely driven by an urge to suffer, we're being motivated by something much more creative: a desire to identify something in the here and now that is broken like it used to be - and then we have a wish to repair it with our adult strengths in the hope of being able to move on and find freedom."

    "Transcript": "How many friends do you have? Most of us would rush to think of a high number. To have to admit to having very few is - in our societies - a marker of shame and failure. But what if being lonely were actually a sign of being an interesting, emotionally sincere and thoughtful person? What if, in a world of superficial alliances, lonely was just what a more serious person tended naturally and legitimately to be? With this in mind, we might take an unusual test that seeks to explore how few friends we might actually have. (1) What do most of your so-called friends not understand about you? You might have many friends, but how well-aligned are they really once you take off a sentimental lens? How many things are there that you wouldn't dream of mentioning? How much of your life has to go on in secret - because no one understands? (2) Who might you turn to if you were disgraced as a result of an error on your part? If a large slice of the world were to turn against you, would there be anyone who would continue to see you as you, and not just as the weirdo or loser that society made you out to be? Who might see you as both guilty and still worthy of affection and kindness? (3) Who would you be able to tell if there was a big problem in your relationship? What if you had had an affair or were drawn to the idea of one? What if your love had cooled despite there being three small children in the house? Who could tolerate your destruction of society's cherished ideals of love? (4) With whom (if anyone) could you discuss your true insecurities or complexities around sex? Although society - at least in certain parts of the world - likes to present itself as immensely open, it's a radically different matter when it comes to our erotic lives: it's tricky to be an elegantly attired Dean of the Business Faculty who wants to …; a tank commander who …; a mother of two delightful children with a longing to …. (5) Who likes the idiot in you? Anyone can like the sensible version of us - who can tolerate the idiot who lurks in all of us, the one who is up late at night doing silly things, who spills things down their front, who messes up at work and says strange things to themselves to stay calm. * These questions deliberately set the bar for friendship higher than usual. We might - having surveyed them - realise that we have very few friends indeed; perhaps even none at all. This is no matter for panic or shame. Many of us are - in fact - in the very same position. And the more of us can realise it, the more we can stop pretending that friendship is as common as we say it is; the less isolated we can feel for not believing in the sentimental picture we presently have of friendship; the readier we can be to one day built a friendship truly worthy of the name."

    "Transcript": "We tend to get very attached to plan As. We'll get married, move into a house near the park, work in financial services, pivot into philanthropy and then end up in a cottage by the sea painting and looking after our grandchildren. Or we'll become a famous actor, play in a selection of thoughtful dramas about the inner life and in time move into production or, perhaps, mentorship. And then life laughs and we get cancer or are fired; or say the wrong thing or declare bankruptcy or get tinnitus or go bipolar. There are around 78 major organs in the body and each one of them can go spectacularly wrong in hugely florid and rapid ways. We're surrounded by millions of people whose aspirations are actively or passively in conflict with our own. We are acutely fragile bundles of nerves and neurons adrift in a sharp-edged random universe. The chances of something going wrong are enormous - and they will. What we therefore need, as much as an education in realising some of ocur dreams, is robust tutorship in making up alternatives. What might we do when the first marriage blows up? When the scandal hits? When our liver packs up? When our eyesight goes? When three best friends die? We should keep our grasp on all plan As tentative and light. This is the person we're married to… for now. This is the house we're living in… at the moment. This is our reputation… at this point in time. Nothing is guaranteed. But then, fortunately, nor are our requirements for survival as fixed as we may have believed. We are creatures who - when we need to - will accept easily enough that the moment has come to die. And from this underused realistic muscle flows a much underappreciated capacity to take difficult thoughts on board. We assumed that we'd always have two legs; now we're going to make do with one. We thought we'd always be able to speak; now we need to type out our intentions on a computer. We imagined we'd never be single again; now we're cooking for one. We thought they'd die first; now we're arranging their funerals. The only prediction we can rely"

    "Title": "How to Be Strong and Resilient",
    "Transcript": "Much of the reason why we give up far too soon, fall into despair and abandon our projects is not because things are hard per se but because they are harder - far harder - than we had ever expected them to be. It isn't necessarily difficulty that sinks us; it's bad notions about what a noble task should legitimately demand. We operate with dangerously inadequate views of what it takes for anything good to happen: of what it might take to have a moderately good relationship, to run a more or less viable business, to have a circle of friends, to be healthy, to build a home or to achieve balance of mind. We lose our tempers, cry and scream - because we perceive injustices where there are in fact only encounters with entirely reasonable and predictable degrees of pain. A wiser society would include in every school curriculum a weekly class titled 'Hell, your future,' which would systematically induct the young into the necessary degrees of suffering required by any worthwhile life. We would realise that we make people strong not by enchanting them with descriptions of a life of opportunities, but by being aptly honest about things tend to go. It isn't in any way either cute or kind to educate a young person for a world that doesn't exist. Thrice married couples would address the young on the complexities of love; cancer survivors would deliver lessons on the preciousness of time; artists and entrepreneurs would testify to the absurd yet vital sacrifices required to produce results that look easy. No young person would be left under the slightest illusion that fulfilling moments demanded anything other than torment - and would, as a result, be in a far better place to attain them one day. The wise keep going not because they are braver, but because they have learnt to be a lot better prepared, by which we mean, a lot sadder. They know that defeats and humiliations are unavoidable events, not freakish punishments. They wonder, at the close of every quiet day, why not more has gone wrong. They succeed on the basis of fully expecting everything to be just about as hard as it really will be."

    "Transcript": "One of the sadder symptoms of not having been treated well in childhood is a remarkable tolerance - and indeed appetite - for not being treated entirely nicely by partners in adulthood. As graduates of rocky pasts, we are at high risk of ending up recklessly passive around partners who don't appear to have too much interest in our true needs and aspirations. Where others would read a sharp risk in such neglect, we simply sense normality. Where others would be plotting an escape, we settle in for the long term. Where others would despair of intransigence or meanness, we see every chance of being able to change a partner - so long as we keep quiet and hope. It can take an awfully long time until we're in any position to realise that - all told - the situation does appear a little strange and somewhat irrevocable, that it may not be entirely to our advantage to be told again and again that we are 'mad' for wanting greater gentleness, or 'demanding' for seeking a deeper connection or 'crazy' for wondering why a partner spends so much time on their phone or out drunk with friends. We could be compared to a giant fish, a tuna perhaps, who has had its fins cut off and lost any powers of navigation, so that it bobs helplessly on the current, hoping against hope that it will be taken somewhere nice, but unable to exert any influence on its course. The famous expression runs: when people show you who they are, believe them. But it's hard to be very clear-eyed about who is good and bad when you happened to grow up with a heavy disincentive to perceive certain awkward truths about your own parents - because you were five years old, trapped in a house with them and love wasn't readily available from anyone else. Our entire perceptual mechanism may have been twisted as a result. Like an animal that can't perceive certain frequencies of light, our emotional eyes may have grown up unable to see difficult traits for what they are. Coldness now just looks like 'honourable absorption in more important tasks'; sarcasm is read as 'wit', being belittled feels like 'care'. We're always more likely to think of ourselves as 'bad' for failing to elicit kindness from a fundamentally lovely person whom we'll continue to adore and admire - despite one or two signs of trouble - as opposed to conceiving that we might have fallen in with a jerk We may be deep into our lives before we decide we might have had enough of suffering, and start to be curious about what kindness and presence might feel like. We may ever so slowly determine that though our partner may be using every ounce of their considerable logic and charm to secure the status quo, they might in the end just be taking us for a long ride. We don't have to be here. We are - astonishingly - not five any more. If we're not happy, we can run. We're free. This is what being an adult should always have been about."

    "Title": "A West African Philosophy of Calm",
    "Transcript": "Among the Yoruba people, an ethnic group of some 52 million spread between Nigeria, Togo and Benin, one of the most flattering ways to describe a person is to say they have much 'itutu.' The word denotes a particular approach to life: unhurried, composed, assured and unflappable. If a bus is late, a person of 'itutu' won't shout or get in a dispute with a ticket vendor, they'll let out a minor sigh and pull a weary smile. If the skies open just when they've laid out chairs in the garden for a party, they will - in their normal tranquil and unaffected way - simply take them all back in again. There isn't much that should rattle a person of 'itutu.' Crucially, 'itutu' isn't any sort of divine gift or chance trait. It's a quality that can be cultivated and is the outcome of having absorbed a particular view of existence. For the Yoruba, agitation and anger flow from a mistaken and over-ambitious sense of what it lies in our power to alter. It's when we believe that we are more in command of external reality than we actually are that we respond to reversals and frustrations with rage. The calm person of 'itutu' may be every bit as sad as their hysterical counterpart about the delayed bus or torrential shower, but what underpins their equanimity is a sense that trouble could not be skirted and must be accepted as belonging to the order of things. In their noble resignation, a person of 'itutu' displays a grasp of another key term in Yoruba philosophy: 'àṣẹ' which we might translate as destiny, existence, or the cosmic order. What lies in the province of 'àṣẹ' can't be altered by any human will but an enlightened person should understand the direction of 'àṣẹ' and then adjust their desires and ambitions accordingly. There is an important detail here: 'itutu' doesn't only render a person wise. It additionally makes them attractive, including physically attractive, and what we might call 'cool' - which is why any self-respecting young Yoruba will strive hard to adopt its outward signs, particularly when a distinguished local photographer like Rachidi Bissiriou has offered to take one's portrait. Many cultures retain a lingering suspicion that being effective might rely on a capacity to be frantic and hot tempered. For the Yoruba, agitation isn't merely an offence to a proper understanding of the universe; it's also just horribly unfashionable."

years ago and that was called a school of Life an emotional education and this is called a therapeutic uh journey and it's really following on from this exploration that I've been on my colleagues been known at the school of life for a number of years into this very broad area which we might call mental well-being um and it's obviously a a vast topic um I should say that I certainly don't believe that it's possible for anyone to be sane is is any is anyone in the room think that they are sane just just let's just have a show of hand anyone who thank goodness um I'm very glad you're obviously a very very sane audience because in the paradoxical way in which these things work the best marker of having at least a measure of Sanity is a friendship with one's more insane sides and um the ability to recognize the extent to which one isn't entirely well and cannot be by the simple nature facts of human nature um this is about as good as we can ever get if any of you dating a very useful way to sift out those who you should continue a meal with or not is simply to turn to your companion at some point normally after the starter at least and say so in what ways are you mad and if the person looks kind of puzzled and angry and defensive and says how do you mean mad just leave I mean put a little bit of money down but quit the restaurant but it's not going to work it's not going to work but if they're able to take the first steps into outlining some of the ways in which they may you know be tricky at points another key question is to ask somebody if they're difficult to live with if if somebody thinks that they're easy to live with again run run it's just this is a very very bad sign so at the school life we very much believe everybody's hard to live with and everybody's insane very good starting point but in this book a therapeutic Journey what we're looking at in particular is the darker side of mental experience um and that is the process of getting mentally unwell it's taken us about you know 2,000 years or so to even be able to mention what should have always have been an extremely almost Common Sense point you which is that just as we get ill in our bodies we of course get ill in our minds there is no such thing as a life that can be spent uh in a mind that is entirely well we tend to like because it's so frightening we tend to try and create a wall a hard separation between the crazy and the same well as you've been as you'll pick up from what I've been saying um I certainly don't believe that that's the case that the border is Shifting The Border is permeable and and um any good and sane life will include uh many moments of what one might as well call insanity this is not a one-way Street it's a constant passage between um uh states of of distress of acute distress and states of Greater wellness it's worth maybe just summarizing or just just trying to look at some of the ways in which um a healthy mind operates because all of us have moments when we are able um to think in healthy ways and it's you know especially when you lose that ability to think to reflect on what healthy thinking is it's really a miraculous thing you know first and foremost what a healthy mind is is an editing machine what it is able to do is to rank thoughts in order of importance and not present Consciousness with the full uh unalloyed uncategorized um panoply of emotions that it could feel at any time things are ranked and things are sometimes compartmentalized and put far away I'm going to talk about defense mechanisms in their more pejorative sense in a minute but it's important to know that the ability not to think of certain things at certain points belongs to health for example if there were thoughts that I was having right now about being here on stage I wouldn't be able to continue my I may not be able to continue much longer but I'm I'm going all right for a few minutes but um if I were to have certain thoughts like what on Earth am I doing here what what what about if people weren't nice to me what about if if I didn't know what I was talking about you all these things would quite quickly trip me out and bring me into a state where I couldn't do what I could do what I can do so in other words in order to function in the world you need to prioritize categorize keep certain thoughts uh at Bay particularly punitive thoughts you know we are all in order to keep going immense optimists we need a boost of optimism all the time to Bear ourselves I mean all of us you know when we are so called down we we tend to have those realistic depressive thoughts goodness I'm rather ugly goodness I'm rather strange goodness I'm so stupid Etc now if those thoughts were allowed to submerge us we couldn't get out of bed there is but to at the core of Health there lies a certain necessary dose of optimism and it's only when we lose that that we start to realize absolutely how key it is not least we have to forget on a daily basis that we're going to die um philosophers love to remind us of death and there are you know real advantages sometimes in a focusing way to remembering death but if we really had to keep uh that thought of death in mind as perhaps we should we couldn't keep going so there's a lot of thought a lot of thinking that we need not to do in order to function as we do but sometimes these very healthy mechanisms of thought and processing start to erode and for a period or perhaps a longer Period start to break down and we enter a state of mental unwellness we're no longer able to categorize our thoughts we're no longer able to prioritize we're no longer able to sleep we're no longer able to therefore benefit from that restart that a fresh morning um uh endows us with when we're able to look again at a topic in in in a certain way we become hyper realists and that hyperrealism becomes unlivable and at its worst life itself starts to seem unendurable um I think that you know many of us have at least tasted a a share of what this might mean hopefully um it was only a little moment in life sometimes it can be longer I would say that very few people get through an entire life without at certain moments slipping into these kinds of territories and this is really what the book is about those moments when we lose our grip on all those processes that the mind has in order to be able to get us through the day now why on Earth does does it happen um there are stresses undoubtedly in daily life um there are things that aggravate a fragile mind but at the school of life and this will annoy everybody so I'm really sorry um we are very focused unfortunately on childhood um sometimes we leave we have we run a YouTube channel and um almost every film we make seems to mention childhood and there's a few people in particular who every time we fil go oh look at them they're going on about childhood again and I feel real sympathy oh my goodness I mean we do seem to go on a lot about childhood um it's really boring to have to think about your childhood many of us are 30 40 50 years decades um out of childhood and still here I am telling you that it's all about your childhood well that's extremely annoying and I really sincerely apologize but the only way to forget about your childhood is to go and explore it we're not exploring childhood for the sake of nostalgia or because we love mommy and dad D or because it was such fun but in order to get rid of the thing once and for all you know these ghosts of the Mind tend to be ghosts that sprung on us in childhood and without um the courage to go back and look at them um we're unable unlikely to find the freedom the calm the creativity that we all um seek you know childhood is I it took Humanity an unbelievable length of time to recognize the role of childhood in adult development I mean you don't find any medieval person going you know the reason I lack confidence is my parents you know there's no ancient Greek who's on record explaining their behavior because of a parental shortfall of affection it just doesn't exist there is no record you know we have to wait until the 20th century before people speak in this way which can of course lead us to a kind of Suspicion you know are we somehow are we modern somehow uniquely pampered obsessive in this area I don't really think so I mean compare it to our discovery of certain kinds of bacteria you know it took until the late 19th century until the age of Freud to realize that at a bacterial level there are things that inhabit jugs of water that on a bad day could kill the population of an entire city that there are macro biotic biological macrob biological organisms that you can't see with a naked eye that have the cap capacity to kill millions of people and it's so implausible and something akin to this goes on in relation to our own childhoods where again slightly invisible processes are at play that have the capacity to fell adult lives uh in ways that are as destructive as a certain kind of poisoning um part of the problem of human beings is they have such an inordinately long maturational process a horse a fo is up and running in you know an afternoon so if baby hores mom and dad are slightly strange or they are suffering from all sorts of things doesn't really matter because they're often often about within the afternoon but we humans you know we're at least 18 19 20 25 until we can get away from these people and these people are likely to be carrying all sorts of distorted patterns which we learn with some of the same natural inevitability as we learn language you know none of us learn our native language by sitting in a classroom and slowly taking it in we simply embi it um passively from the surrounding environment while we're doing handstands in the garden drawing buttercups at the kitchen table we are learning languages um that people are speaking around us and it's not just languages in the grammatical sense we are also learning at all times emotional languages who can we trust what is a man what is a woman what is what am I what is my worth um how what will happen if I reach out and try and communicate with another person all of these things all of these conclusions the language that we learn um is being taken in all the time and it becomes a very dense native language now of course we know um how hard it is in adulthood to start learning Finnish if we grew up speaking Korean and how hard it is when you're a native English speaker to pick up Spanish you know we'll know that we've probably got to go to language school three four times a week we might need to do it for years Etc people get very impatient when you start telling them you have learned certain a certain emotion language and if you want to try and correct it it's going to be a huge labor you know you might need let's say to go to therapy once a week even twice a week and three times a week and they go oh what are you kidding you think I've got time to do that um surely you can just you know read a book just this the book will'll give it now this book is a fantastic start but the bad news the bad news is not enough it's not enough even though it runs to 400 pages and has you know a wealth of insights not enough it's just the beginning of the journey you're going to have to go on but be patient with yourself as I say think of how long it took you to learn English or whatever language is your native language think how complicated it would be to change that language it's no easier to start to learn a new language of men and women and relationships and self-esteem and confidence all of these things are just as knotted and just as firmly embedded uh in US um many many of us almost say all of us suffer from what nowadays is a little bit of a fash f aable word but like many fashionable words it has its use traumatized we have all suffered trauma in childhood now what is trauma trauma is essentially The Experience uh an experience that is both painful and at the age and at the stage where where it is experienced It is incomprehensible we simply cannot frame it process it digest it or make sense of it so it is swallowed in an undigested form that is what it is to be traumatized and as we know know and this is one of the great discoveries of 20th century Psychotherapy the only I think the only way in which trauma can be handled is if we go back and unpick it and understand it and thereby process it and let it um Liber and and work a Liberation from its effect which we have not understood you know most mental troubles come from things that have not been properly looked at anxiety for example is worry that doesn't understand understand itself depression is sadness that has become unknown to us and therefore has bled across the whole of Our Lives irritability is Rage that doesn't know its true Target you know why when you open the drawer and you can't open it and you get into absolute Fury and you start hitting the drawer and you go where is the damn key it's not just me you do this too we all do this too right um and then you think hang on a minute it's not the drawer is it now it's something else why why am I in such a race R and that terrible thing that we have to start to think I'm not understanding myself I'm I'm diverting Rage which belongs in one place and I'm kicking the dog I'm kicking the drawer I'm kicking the driver whatever it is um many of our emotions do not find their correct targets and the reason is that their correct targets are extremely awkward to come to understand for example it's really nice to think that your parents are lovely and you love them of course you know that's the way it should be so to imagine that you're in a real Rage with them that's that's kind of awkward or maybe you're in a rage with your partner well that's a bit awkward because you're supposed to love them um brief diversion into sex why do people stop having sex some of you stopped having sex well um the standard Common Sense view is this is just a sign of time passing we go off people no no no no we don't it's a sign of Frozen rage um all of us upset our partners all the time in quite small ways ways you know partner comes home and goes got a really interesting story to tell you go just I just got to make a phone call you pick up your phone and start looking at something now your partner is not going to you know scream at you probably they'll just take it on the chin because they've learned they're a good boy or girl they've learned to be brave and to be an adult but none of us are adults in relationships all of us come to relationships as essentially adult shell three or four or fivey old inner being and so when when Partners say to each other grow up you want to go this is not the game where you grow up you know growing up is for the office the domestic sphere the domestic sphere is one where we can't help but bring a very small toddler with us and that toddler is extremely vulnerable and it gets hurt all the time you know that slightly cutting remark that you made about your partner at a party quite funny everybody laughed well they didn't laugh and now it's 3 weeks later and they're still pretty upset the problem is they don't know they're upset why don't they know they're upset because anger does not communicate itself cleanly to us they are out of touch with their emotions all of us are constantly getting out of touch with our emotions and a lot of our so-called illnesses are the result of Legions of emotions that have lost sight of their true aim because we are not very well equipped to repatriate our emotions and find out who is that anger really meant for and as I say some of the reason for that is that the anger that is due to certain people we think I'm supposed to be nice so how could I be in a rage with my mother she's really nice she's very lovely she gave me a Christmas present Etc um how could I be angry with my partner they seem so you know I'm married to them etc etc all these things that stop us from understanding the complexities of our own lives and therefore end us up in these kind of knots comeing back to sex you know one of the things that happens then is um when a lot of accumulated anger that doesn't know itself has come to Lodge in our mind Minds the last thing we want is to be touched why would we be touched by someone we're in a rage with I don't want to be touched by someone I'm in a rage with but thing is we don't know we're in a rage the partner definitely doesn't know we're in a rage no one knows what's going on everyone's reading a lot of books good for penguin but other than that not such a great time in bed you know quite quite boring because no one knows what on Earth's going on until maybe slowly you find your way to something that says might might I be in some ways in a rage School of Life we make these cards these dating cards we're supposed to take them with on a date and ask your your your partner uh all kinds of questions and one of the questions which is phenomenally useful such a simple question you go on a date night with your partner and you say to them is it possible that I might have annoyed you recently and how how have I annoyed you recently and the thing is everyone annoys everyone recently so it's a fantastic question you can ask um and if you're able to you know get it out over dinner without hitting each other joke joke we're not condoning um all sorts of um bad behavior but if you can do it politely with Grace with humor with kindness you know none of us need perfect Partners we need Partners who are able to have an insight into their imperfections and to communicate these imperfections before they've done us too much damage in a way that we can absorb and vice versa that is a good a good relationship so anyway um I'm I'm trying to evoke the idea of a um a landscape in which so much of what we've feel is outside of our conscious command very useful exercise to do to try and win back more of the emotional territory in the name of processing is to um at night uh last thing at night to just make a little bit of time to go back through the day and just go what's coming up for me here what am what am I feeling here what are the emotions that I haven't sufficiently felt and it could be rather surprising thing it doesn't always have to be bad things you could say you know I was totally moved by the sight of a tree at midday and I I just want to think a little bit more deeply about this or or maybe there is a kind of regret that I felt and I've not been able to process it all day so being able not just to live but to make time to process the act of living seems at the heart of trying to do that process of mental hygiene that seems so so important um I was going to tell you about difficult childhoods and um sometimes people say we don't know what a good childhood is who knows what a good childhood is um it's so subjective no one knows what a good parent is we can't tell well I think that there are a lot of generalizations loose it's not a scientific study but there are things we can broadly say will be going on in a good childhood a childhood that sets us up well for mental well-being and later life and conversely things that might be missing from a childhood which will at least aggravate the possibility of reaching adult life in a more fragile uh State um number one and most simply um to feel that you are at the center of the parental world for a time for a time is absolutely essential to a feeling of well-being there's a terrific anxiety in some parents you know you can spoil a child well look you can't really spoil a child when a child is 6 months or a year or two years you know then later on yes you you know there are moments when of course you can start to put boundaries on the child's if you like egania but the egoists the so-called narcist the proverbial narcissists of adult life the people who are grandiose these are not the people who were made to feel like a little emperor when they were one the people who were made to feel like little Emperors when they were one are very happy in adult life to take their place among everybody else and not stand out the Disturbed people need to build careers where they come on stage and they speak to lots of people always you know a sign if if you're a good parent a sign that you're doing a good job is that your child has no desire to be famous if your child has a desire to be known by anyone other than three or four people something's going wrong pay them more attention they're lacking right they're compensating so um uh in a way that that whole that whole narrative that to give a child too much attention creates an egoist I don't believe is true in the early years or children need to feel is that you know the universe has opened up to produce them and they are at the center they are the sun and the moon and the stars and every time they walk into the kitchen everybody's delighted and every time they utter something it's fantastic and every time they do a drawing it's great now this doesn't go on forever but in the very early days this belongs to solidity that is how you I believe how you solidify a a personality um and part of what that means is that a parent has to attune themselves to the needs of a small person now that's really weird and difficult because small children are really quite bizarre creatures the things they care about the things they're invested in are really surprising to an adult mind but a a good enough parent gets down on the level of a child and tries to see the world through their eyes a world in which you know if no-no's eye has fallen off you know noooo the pet rabbit if his eye has fallen off it's a tragedy it is actually a tragedy now if you stand back as out go that's not a tragedy son it's going to be you know there's going to be a lot more tough stuff coming your way it's true but it's not helpful all right stoicism is a fantastic philosophy not for the under ones okay it's just not it's not brilliant this is what went wrong with Great Britain this is the history of Great Britain RIT large you know boarding schools fantastic when you're 40 it's called the Army before that no Spar is that um so Attunement to the needs of a of of a small child you know parents have a very bad habit of not quite listening to their children and the reason if you have a child that's very very noisy it's often a sign that you think you're listening but you're not quite I was um I was at a Holiday Resort a few months ago and there were some parents objectively very nice and there was a child having a little bit of a difficult time on holiday quite a sort of nice resort by the beach all very nice nice buffet breakfast buffet and the child at breakfast was saying child must have be I didn't know three and it was saying I hate it here I want to go home this place is poo quite loudly everybody was hearing this nice dining room was poo we all looked at our plates a little bit worried right and the mother uh was saying obviously she meant well you know we all we all mess up as parents but the mother was saying don't be silly you're having a lovely time it's the holidays and this hotel's very expensive I mean kind of sensible but it's not not really listening and similarly you know a child returns home from school going Mommy Daddy I want to kill the Headmaster I want to blow up the school and the parent will go the parents will go don't be so silly that's ridiculous uh you know the police would get you if you did that sort of thing again that's not really what the kid is saying really what the kid's saying is um I'm really unhappy uh I want to let off steam I'll be okay tomorrow but you know ah I want to be in a rage for for a minute and then I'll get better and you know the ability to gift the child that kind of airtime is that is love that is the work of love and we can't do it all the time anyone who's been a parent I've been a parent you cannot do it all the time but if you can do it sometimes that is a wonderful uh gift incidentally wonderful gift for adults too you know we live live in a culture where people are always going you know everyone's speaking no one's listening what on Earth is listening well listening is the the great thing by the way if you um it's Christmas coming up in a few months and many of you be thinking what do I get my partner Etc good news is here's a gift you can give them simply write them an IOU saying I will listen to you for half an hour every day for a month I could say half an hour a day a month that's not very good but this is really this is the luxury of luxuries but you've got to do it properly now what is it to listen properly so when the partner comes home and says God I really hate my boss they're so annoying and they're so you know and and and the other things that buzz in marketing is an idiot and then the sales people are awful and blah blah blah and I hate everybody and and I feel terrible about myself Etc and not listening is to say look you know happened to me a few a few years ago I was in sort of the same position as as as you let me tell you a few things first thing you need to do get out of the pad first thing you need to do is just like write down who the people are that you're not getting on with and then and then get a chart and no no what you need to do is do a very simple thing but very hard thing which is to reflect back what they're saying you simply need to find other words to capture what they've just told you so you need to go I'm hearing that works a nightmare for you at the moment I'm hearing that a lot of people that you're working with is sort of driving you to distraction and that you're feeling that it's not very good for you and that you're feeling kind of low about that and I I hear that and you'll be having sex tonight if you do that um definitely definitely and it's going to really you know boy things up right and it's so simple but we go to the ends of the Earth we do almost anything other than do that so try that um what are the other things that uh that parents uh uh uh parents do um they understand that childhood is full of odd phases that children want all sorts of things that but they're not threatened by the childishness of the child it takes immense inner maturity to be able to tolerate the immaturity of of a child also you know it's a painful thing to to acknowledge but many parents do fall um for envying their own children it's very taboo what does it mean envy your own children you're going to you're going to envy your child you you know yes yes it happens a lot in small ways and large um and it's just you know probably all of us who are parents who've been parents have had moments where we thought hang on a minute this kid is having a better life than I am not sure I'm entirely happy and we may small ways just want to make sure that we're not too left behind and you know it's a dark truth but the ability to gift a child a better life than the one you've had it's it requires a lot of maturity and a lot of Courage it doesn't come easily um the other thing that a good parent is able to do is to be a little bit boring um no one wants an exciting parent the role of mother or father you want to be seen by your um children as predictable as having no particularly you having a very simple sort of life that you know all your complexities that you wake up at 3:00 in the morning your kids don't want to know you know you are a complicated human being to be a parent is at some level to be a skillful actor or an edited down human because we simply in order for a child to to come into its own full complexity it doesn't need to have the parents complexity always in front of it and this is as it were a gift not to have to reveal too much of the agony of Being Human too early to uh to a child um if a childhood goes well the number one outcome of a childhood going well is how the child feels about itself not about the parents I mean parents is that's another thing all sorts of facts come in but all you need to do is to wonder it's a very simple exercise right how do you feel about yourself whether you're a decent person a good person an okay person deserve to be on the earth or not right out of 10 who basically feels that they're in the kind of 8 to 10 group like more or less they feel good about being them who who feels that they're more or less in that category little show of hands of those people okay good good and who's maybe in the zero to three you know their life may be going well but somehow they just just don't really like themselves just like the whole thing is rather who's who's in that group with me okay okay so this gives you a flavor all of us have had different childhoods the story of childhood is refracted in one's own estimation of oneself that's where you pick up as it were how we feel about ourselves and you know broadly speaking a lack of love has made us ill and it only really the presence of love that can heal us and by love I don't just mean um romantic love though romantic love could be part of it it could also be friendship and it can also be Psychotherapy um and um let me talk a little bit about Psychotherapy um at the school of life we're great very keen on Psychotherapy uh this book is called a therapeutic Journey but let me start by saying they're probably one or two psychotherapists in the room so with apologies to them many many psychotherapists are not quite how do I put it um suitable for you uh they might not be right for you um and so I know many people who've said well I tried that and the guy was so weird or you know the whole thing was so odd I'm never going back there again and I understand that I think we have to look at therapy a little bit like we might look at dating in other words you you don't go off the whole subject of a relationship because you've been on one date one bad date or two bad dates you have to keep searching but many therapists don't suit many clients and so you have to kind of look around to get a good fit but if there is something that's really good about Psychotherapy it's this so because of childood hood and because of the language that we learned in childhood all of us have acquired expectations of how the world is and how the world will respond to US based on um certain things that happened in the microcosmic world of the family so we we extrapolate from what happened in the family and generalize outwards to the whole world it's a natural thing that we do but it means that because our families of origin are generally carrying a lot of warps and a lot of distortions we're likely to approach um adult life full of expectations that are not necessarily very fair either on ourselves or on other people so for example we may think that everybody thinks we're boring or everyone's out to get us or anyone that we try to love is going to humiliate us or that in order to um uh uh win anyone's favor we'll always have to agree with them or whatever it is we carry stories of what what we need to do to get loved and also what the what we can expect from the world and these stories carry distortions now normally we play out these distortions in The Busy World of relationships and the office and our friendships and no one quite notices so you know and also they're doing their stuff back to us so everyone's kind of projecting wildly into one another you know someone's going everyone hates me and the other one's going I want to aggress everyone and you know it's just a mess of of projections and counter projections and no one sees what's going on and there's no um reason or or or ultimately forgiveness or reconciliation but what can happen in therapy is you take your issues and when it's going well you play them out with the therapist so you become really convinced that the therapist hates you because you're so boring and because therapy is just a room with a therapist um the therapist can actually observe that and go no I don't think that's necessarily right but I think I'm finding you quite interesting the the therapist can see in a kind of petri dish things that are normally just lost in the complexity of the the day-to-day world and therefore there's a chance to correct what's going on so that all those sightly strange ideas like you know that um in order to um uh get anyone's love we have to entertain them all the time or or or or whatever that these things are not necessarily correct so we have a chance in the the the sort of clinical and clean confines of a therapy room to see what we're doing uh and get a chance to question whether it's still makes sense it has an origin but that origin May no longer be fair to reality as we as we have to live it um and one of the key things to to reflect on is that you know we often see people who do things that look a bit crazy right like we see somebody and they're all the time I don't know um not succeeding at things they could succeed at or they are you know pulling out of relationships that looked promising or they are putting up a wall when anyone tries to love them or they're sabotaging their chances or you know whatever and we think why they why does that person do it it's completely crazy there's no logic to it here's a very important point there is always a logic those behaviors which look in inverted commas crazy Once Upon a Time made great sense I want to go further not only did they make great sense they were very often the difference between life and death between managing to continue with life and giving up on life we needed those patterns imagine imagine the following scenario right imagine somebody who grows up with a parent who is suicidal right um they are threatening suicide they suicide commit suicide right how on Earth does a child survive that experience right well one of the ways that they might uh learn to survive that experience is to shut down completely right they will never ever let anyone in because to let someone in is to risk their own Annihilation right and that when you're 5 years old to work that out that is near on genius to work out that in order to survive you need to shut the drawbridge very tight fast forward to 25 35 45 family Situation's resolved itself in whatever way uh and you've moved on and you're trying to have relationship or whatever but in a horrible way that defense mechanism is still active and now it's trouble right because now it means that when somebody comes along and says oh we could have a relationship mm no not possible because the drawbridge is still shut so a lot of the behavior that is suboptimal in adult life once had a logic which we don't understand and we're not sympathetic to we don't even see it but if we can learn to see that logic we can largely then come to UNP pick it or imagine somebody who let's say we all know these people who can't stop joking around somebody who let's say is completely optimistic and sunny and even when something's sad they're at a funeral they're like oh you be and they're making a joke about the casket and whatever and you want to go where's your sadness what why are you not able to get in touch with your sadness that's what one feels right there's a sort of um unreal relationship to the world again imagine that that former child has come through a journey where one once upon a time it was absolutely essential that that person be the clown and cheer up maybe a depressive mother or a father who was you know very angry and um couldn't couldn't find anything optimistic that child needed to become a clown to get to the next stage of life but now that precise Behavior starts to be extremely negative you know another thing that children constantly do when children are brought up in suboptimal surroundings right with parents who maybe not that nice to them um it would be devastating to the child to have to see that the fault lies with their parent right to to to to imagine when you're a fouryear old that your father or or or mother is really not a very nice person and maybe really quite Disturbed and kind of awful right this is an unbearable thought and this was the work of a pioneering Scottish psychoanalyst called Ronald faban wonderful psychoanalyst who discovered he was working with very deprived people people in Edinburgh and Glasgow in the 1930s and he arrived at a fascinating conclusion he talked to children from the most deprived most violent most abusive families and he discovered that those children spoke very highly of their parents they would say my father he's a great man you this is the guy who was hitting the child my mother she's amazing mother you know left the the kid unclean unfed for days what was going on well in Fair Ben's view um it's better to to think that you are the problem than that you've been born into a problematic situation so what happens when you're in a suboptimal parental situation is you start to hate yourself and blame yourself and feel bad about yourself because it is preferable to the other bit of really bad news which is to think that you've been born into such an inadequate family that um you may not survive it so this is the way in which the Mind twists itself buys itself peace but you know with with at Great cost for for the long term many of our symptoms it should say end up in our bodies you know our minds our minds are very frightened of insight and most of the time they will try and ward off Insight but there's also another part of our mind that wants to know the truth about our childhoods about our parents about our caregivers about who we are right and there's a constant push and pull between the forces of repression and the forces of honesty right and it constantly is a a kind of tussle and you know you can imagine it as a knock on the door please please think a little bit more give me some time to process and if we're constantly busy um well most obvious uh symptom is insomnia what is insomnia other than the mind's Revenge if you like for all those thoughts that you tried so hard not to have in the day that have come back at 3:00 a.m. because they need to be heard what are certain kinds of bodily symptoms other than messages from the mind that haven't found a verbal conscious mechanism of expression you know when you're double doubled up with back pain with lower back pain right what's your back trying to tell you um what are your shoulders trying to tell you what's your stomach trying to tell you our organs are very often the emissaries of messages that we haven't found a conscious way of addressing so the body starts to be an organ through which we are having to speak to ourselves in a kind of code it's very painful doctors can't work it out because for a doctor what is lower back pain other than a physiological uh event when of course it it is a psychological event or sometimes of course not not always but sometimes it's a psychological event that hasn't had a chance to to understand itself um I think we're going to have some time quite a lot of time for questions and answers and um and a chance to have a a disc um but really ultimately just to kind of sum up the sort of drift of where I've been taking you um think of Socrates who at the dawn of Western Civilization he's asked what is the goal of Life what is the highest purpose of human beings answers rather paradoxically very beautifully know yourself right and follows it up with the thought the unexamined life is not worth living why is it not worth living because the unexamined life is that bit more painful it's that bit less creative it's that bit less stuck in patterns that we didn't ask for and that are limiting who we can be so Liberation awaits us when we can have the courage to see that most of us are in some ways bent crouching um hedged in by aspects of the past that we haven't yet had the opportunity to know and that the prize of a little bit kinder to oneself and a little bit more connected to other people at an authentic and sincere level thank you so much so thank you so much Ella we're going to take questions in groups of three so um I begin on that side great so um I can't quite see you but I'll hear you um so whenever uh whenever you're ready um first of all thank you very much um for being um a person bringing an inspiration and perspective um in my life personally and and relationship too um my question is related to your initial remark around um anger and rage um in particular in regards to fear of an abandonment so I wonder um if you have any thoughts or perspectives you can share in that regard how to to nurture um sort of embracing that aspect of of emotions yes look it's such an interesting question you know we hear nowadays a lot about people Pleasers right I sometimes think you know that issue of anger is quite connected to the issue of a people pleaser what is a people pleaser it's really somebody who hasn't been gifted the opportunity to see that their own reality could be acceptable to many many people at many many junctures of course not always at all times but that they've got such a low threshold for accepting their own ideas perspectives on things that the only way in which they feel they can be loved is to submit to whatever authorities are around to agree and um you know I think you'll be picking up from just what I've been saying what's what's going to be the history of people pleasing again trying to educate you in the role of looking backwards what's we don't know exactly but the history for people pleasa generally has a situation where the truth of the growing child was not acceptable to an adult and therefore the uh child imbibed a view that the only way in which to prove acceptable was to shut up and accept whatever happened to be around the Nazis are good people oh yes yes very nice thank you very much uh you know it's a great idea to murder children in their oh yes thank you yes because you don't have any courage to stand up for your own truth and you know that lack of confidence which many of us know I mean you know it's it's it's tragedy comic um is is really the legacy of not feeling that we could be ourselves and accepted you know the wonderful psychoanalyst Donald winot says it makes this great distinction between the true self and a false self and he says that a um a functioning adult life has those true selves and false selves in a good balance the true self is what you really think what you really believe what you really want some of it is quite difficult and small children especially if they're in a loved environment will let you know their true self quite sort of you know vifer usly from a from a young age they'll they they'll scream that they want more more video they they want the TV they they want to eat something they want to stay up all night play have a pillow fight Etc but they're letting you know what they really want of course adults can then have to accommodate that in different ways but the the the the the the way in which wiot interpreted is that a false self should then grow up on top of the true self right the false self is designed to mediate between the true self and the outside world so when your boss comes along yeah you might not want to tell them the whole truth when you know someone you know when an important guest comes to your house you may want to slightly fake certain things etc etc right we need a false self to function in the world but in order to be able to tolerate the demands of the false self the true self has to have been allowed a little bit of a runaround and a compromised life is when that balance is sort of out of sync so Health means getting that true self FAL self balance uh uh uh in order so to answer your question um what you know what do we need to do in order to have a a a better relationship to our anger first of all understand how is it that anger came to be so frightening to us right how did our own anger I'm not talking here about violent Expressions you sometimes we we shoot so far to the other end we're not talking about doing anyone harm we're talking about registering a deep unhappiness with a situation right there's the act of anger and there's the feeling of anger and the more we disallow ourselves from the feeling of anger the more that uh that feeling then has to emerge as symptoms as symptomatic anger and that is irritability uh that is insomnia that is bowel troubles etc etc so make friends with your own shadow side you think of that very useful yian idea of the Shadow side that there are many bits of us that is currently in Shadow the side of us that has slightly strange sexual thoughts that is sometimes angry that that wants to give it all in and move to another country that that that has odd thoughts about their friends Etc these things are in Shadow in most of us and the goal of life is to try and move as much of what is currently in Shadow into the light not in order to act on it right because some of the reason why we we we don't want to bring things out of the Shadow is that we think that if we do we'll have to act on it no no no there's an enormous difference between tolerating a thought and acting on a thought and come back to anger the ability to tolerate the thought of one's anger is the beginning of an easier relationship to one's very legitimate sense of frustration with the world I've heard it said that um the end of suffering is the beginning of wisdom and um I'm wondering what you would Advocate to get us there does everybody need to be on psychotherapy um uh does everybody need to be in Psychotherapy um yes and no um I mean no in the sense not everybody needs to go to an actual therapist you know 50 minutes a week or more um not necessarily but I think everybody has to be involved with a word which is in the title of the book what you might call the therapeutic which is in other words an aliveness to um well number one you know what's the Bedrock of psychotherapy the unconscious right that that very you know sometimes it's so it's so ubiquitous we forget what an extraordinary idea Freud bequeathed the world uh at the beginning of the 20th century when he posited and and it sort of sounds odd surely humans had realized this before and they sort of ish had but not really that most of mental functioning is unconscious in other words there's an enormous amount of who we are what we want what we feel that we don't know about um and for Freud's you know again the Bedrock of the psychotherapeutic is um a lot of the material that is unconscious causes us trouble um it has been driven into the unconscious in order to spare us pain but long term we buy that avoidance of pain at a very high price and that a a good life is one where are able to stomach as much of our own truth as possible and the only way in which we'll be able to do that is about another words that's key love love for ourselves love that we've been shown by others kindness that is the tool that's going to allow us to tolerate ourselves rather than tear ourselves apart or build walls in our mind between what we can see and accept and what is simply um too appalling given how we feel about ourselves go for it just have a question in the back there y hi sorry yeah here um hi thanks Alan that was really brilliant talk uh I just wanted to know to what extent do you think people can wake up and just have a bad day and the reason I asked that is because there are some days where I wake up and feel that my neurochemical was off balance and I seem to just hate the world so yeah I just want to know what are your thoughts about that yes I mean absolutely and you know you you you talk about an imbalance at a sort of chemical level you know I think one of the things one of the many things that we have to kind of accept is that we are these strange creatures where our big brains cohabit with a body which has certain needs and demands and you know sometimes this particular era of of sort of people who spend a bit too long in their own brains that you know Suddenly at certain point they'll go there is no meaning to life all humans are cruel there is nothing worth living for all of my careful reasoning leads me to suppose that existence has no purpose or meaning and you're thinking H why is this person reasoning in these sort of thoughtful ways towards such negativity and the reason could be that they're really taking a survey of reality and that's their conclusion or they're missing 3 hours sleep they're 3 hours Short of sleep and that's why they're coming up with all these theories that the relationship's broken they hate their children the Nations going to pot Etc it could be that they need an orange juice quite fast right and and sometimes especially as you know thoughtful people we underestimate the claims on the body so we should never get so clever that we deny the possibility that our clever clever thoughts are really just uh an out the outcome of as I say a shortage of of glucose or or or something like this I mean parents of small children know this you know when a formerly Sunny child is like you know dancing around and doing wonderful things suddenly goes I hate Mommy I hate daddy I'm going to kill myself they don't quite say that do they but um that sort of thing you know gets very tragic um a sort of novice parent might panicing oh my goodness I've I've got to got to try and help the child to make the world and you know and a more experienced parent goes right nap time straight to bed half an hour nap it'll all be better in half an hour so we remain you know key Point Key point you know keep you know we're Russian dolls right and there is there remains an infant within us and that infant unfortunately gets tired and when it gets tired it gets very tragic and the best thing that the parental side of us can do is go right we're going to go to bed we're not thinking any more of this I'll address this in the morning if it's still so pressing okay we'll call schopenhauer n we'll read daycard Etc but probably it would have blown over and we can we can move on I think um thank you for that um that was as insightful as f as always but um um I wondered what do you think are the drawbacks of um Psychotherapy because as a society we're constantly sort of incentivized to look inwards oh um if you're feeling bad do some mindfulness do some yoga have a gratitude journal and so on so these are the kinds of solutions that were given to us to things like the pandemic and I wonder it kind of promotes this belly button view of a world where we're constantly looking at ourselves in the mirror and the mirror and the mirror and there's some step where you have to look outwards and act in the world and actually help your neighbor and and do some volunteering and do things that don't necessarily uh focus on you and what you are but how we can change the world and things out there so where does the boundary lie between introspection and action yes look such a good question and you know I I I couldn't really give it justice but but look I'd say that um the goal ultimately Psychotherapy is not more Psychotherapy it's to be done with the whole thing precisely so that one can then look outwards um the thing is that there's no point saying to somebody who's mentally unwell pull yourself together stop thinking about yourself so much it's like you know the last thing the person wants to do who's in a wretched State of Mind is think about themselves the reason they're thinking so much about themselves is because they're desperate that you know they would love to forget all about themselves and to go off and be an active member of society so we have to be a little bit careful in saying you know because then gets to boarding school stoicism of like you know what person should just pull their socks up and get on with life and you know they would love a mentally unwell person would love to get on with life more than anything they just can't and then the question is what do we do with that person and yes sometimes an orientation towards outside can jog the Mind towards you know A New Perspective absolutely but if a problem is rooted somewhere in the psyche and somewhere in a in in a story of trauma and difficulty um you know I I'm revealing my my prejudices I I think that the only game in town probably is going to be to take that on board you know because if I come back to the language acquisition Theory we have acquired a language and we're going to have to try and correct that language and the only way to do that is to notice we're speaking it um and simply as it were're changing the subject while sometimes helpful um I think you know is is um you know could be tricky but look I I'm aware this is a very difficult subject and you know I am I'm generalizing and you know if if some of you thinking hang on a minute that didn't work for my friend or you know blah blah blah I get it I get it this is this is me generalizing and it's you know it's the it's it's the the sort of perils of um standing up on a stage and and coming up with um with with clever sounding sentences it it it's very newas and and I think you know it's important to say the field of mental unwellness is incredibly complicated and requires huge sort of care as we move across it and um and and it's something that you know um I try never to forget that there are so many angles so many so many different cases etc etc and so part of it is just um having as much experience trying out as many things as as as as a right for you um because they really it is hard at some point for an outsider to say that's going to make you better that and only that very very hard very hard yeah hello hi Alan and thank you for the wisdom thank you for the questions I have a practical one now that I have your book I'm wondering who did you write it for did you write it for the parents to make sure that we're not traumatizing our kids or did you write it for the kids to try to deal and rewrite the story and the patterns um well you know it's going to be a sort of silly sounding answer but both both because you know what is a parent other than a former child and what is a child other than a future maybe parent or at least caregiver or person you know who will one day have authority over somebody and a capacity either to harm or or to help and you know one of the painful things about about life is that of course there's intergenerational transmission of problems and many of us are really dealing in our adult life with the problems with which our parents were grappling I mean interesting thought exercise think about you know you won't have a scientific answer to this but if you just sort of as it were try and imagine maybe tonight lying in bed shut your eyes and think what were my parents grappling with what you know if I had to try and sum up what were the main challenges of my parents' life maybe you know they had to I don't know achieve a certain kind of status or free themselves from their parents or assert their Identity or create a you know whatever it may be and then think well what's my relationship to the parental struggle and you know there's a there's a sort of eerie frightening poignant way in which very often you know the kids are trying to help their parents in in in some way or the problem that is was in the parent has found a form within the child and the child is trying to deal with it and trying to heal the parent the parent may be long dead but still the child is trying to think about what might have helped the parent so I wrote this book for my parents hello hello hello hello yeah hi alen thank you for your talk um I found your um Insight on being therapeutic uh in examining the unconscious very very insightful um my question is the way we frame mental health um compared to physical health today and tell me if that comparison is wrong um when we talk about physical health Health we talk about physical health but when we talk about mental health we're talking about mental illness uh we don't talk about physical health just about diabetes or heart diseases or knee problem we talk about endurance flexibility strength and all sorts of that but when it comes to mental health we just talking about problems no good markers to know how we are progressing with other equivalence to strength endurance so would you share some thoughts on what do you think is a good mental health not talk about um traumas and others things yes I mean such a good question sounds ridiculous but I know we do have a list in this book on what mental health is because I I couldn't agree with you more absolutely 100% um you know it's such things it's such Maneuvers as for example um the capacity to forgive oneself and this could sound odd what does that mean forgive oneself well but literally to to not um uh relentlessly return the mind to its worst moments um this belongs to health um the capacity to achieve perspective on things in other words to to grade issues and to assign you know a one to one a three to another a 10 to another but not to have everything as a 10 the ability to grade problems um the ability to sequence thoughts so that not everything um is coming at you uh at once that you're able to to create as it were an order line for your thoughts um and that you're able to devote sustained energy to unpicking certain things without being overwhelmed by the whole lot I mean they sound rather banal and you know they are quite they are quite Bal but they're the bedrocks of mental well-being and it's only when mental health goes we think oh my goodness I cannot stop thinking as if it were today about an incident 12 years ago I'm I'm now and 12 years ago have have stopped um you know or that you're unable to stop having an argument with someone who died 30 years ago you are still having the argument in your head you might be waking up in the middle of the night saying that's unfair and you're speaking to a dead person right this is what happens to people whose Minds have slipped out of their normal control that that time and the and the ability of time to sequence emotional events has has disappeared um so anyway there there's a whole long list of factors but you're absolutely right to draw our attention to it you know can we as it were go to the gym and do exercises in this area as we can yes and the book has some um but also it's it's also about gratitude to to just work you know when you are feeling okay notice what you're doing notice what you're doing that you're able to say ah I'm going to get on to that tomorrow morning I don't need to do that now or ah I don't need to give myself such a hard time this is mental health in action um and you know sometimes we think mental health in such weird terms such diverse terms you know whether it's going to a clinic or an everyday form of mental ill health some of the same factors are at play and it is about essentially destroying oneself and there are many many ways of destroying oneself yeah think just a probably couple of couple more questions hi yeah I was wondering how much you think these ideas can be taken to a societal level you started your talk by saying how fundamental optimism is to mental health and it feels like part of what's so broken in society at the moment is that we have fundamentally lost the faith we've lost the ability to collectively imagine a better future and indeed that it feels like a deliberate political tactic to Prey Upon that malaise and their overwhelm to produce the worst forms of paralysis or nativist politics or kind of defensive and cruel politics even in the worst cases and I'm wondering how you think a a society can examine its shadow self what that looks like in practice and how you come out of the other side um look I I feel your passion and unfortunately I share it you know unfortunat I mean I wish I didn't but I I I I fear you're absolutely right um uh the causes are many but um you know we know that bad news sells we know that alarm um uh gets eyeballs etc etc so the forces of kindness the forces of calm the forces of perspective are now more endangered than ever the forces of optimism the forces of utopianism the forces of imagining a better world all of these things are you know in in Retreat um look I would say it's individual by individual if you're a parent every child that you manage to raise in the world who ha who is self-possessed who is calm who has a measure of optimism who has not been so badly treated that they need to treat others badly is a win you know and let's let's let's U really try and understand this we live in a society of widespread sadism sadism is a defense mechanism what is sadism sadom is something H bad happened to me it's intolerable that it happened to me what's the way that I'm going to deal with it I'm going to make life hell for somebody else right I will take my injury and I will put it on somebody else um masochism is also difficult but there's less masochism around we're much more a sadistic Society where we're constantly doing past the parcel with our wounds um and I think you know at a psychological level I mean you I I I noticed that your question is political and I could answer it politically I I'm going to because of where we are today I'm going to answer it psychologically and as if you're psychoanalytically every time that a human being enters adulthood having felt a reserve of Love they don't need to be sadistic towards somebody else they don't need to get their kicks from from passing on cruelty and and that's the beginning of societal change and a good Society is one ultimately where the balance between those who need to make others suffer and those who are feel good enough about themselves that they will be enriched through kindness when that balance is is in trained so I've answered it psychoanalytically as I say I know there's a political angle as well hello so I hope I can articulate my question well but please correct me if I don't my question is about uh trauma and childhood and I was just wondering if our bodies sort of pick and choose the traumas they want to uh basically uh keep the score of and remind us of 30 40 years later and the reason I ask is because I would be talking to someone and i' mentioned what I think is a a normal and just general thing that happened in my life and they'd be appalled but then I would be really hung up on things that other people would find ridiculous that Mak sense I I didn't fully understand so you think that people people's assessment of what is a traumatic incident feels quite subjective I think you're saying right there is no there's no sort of um rule book about what is considered a trauma and I think I think that's correct that um you know it it it it is um you know what matters is how an incident was interpreted and felt by an individual um and and different things will affect different people because you know the context is very uh different for some people you know a parent will leave and that's okay because the surrounding environment was such that you know that could be born that absence could be born for others it may be you know a a tear through their life which they'll be wrestling with until the day they die um it a lot does depend on the susceptibility of the individual and and what else is is is is going on which is why you know I think the um I think we should be very careful to grade other people's traumas for them to say that's not serious you know and again parents do that you know parents will say um you know uh you know baby tiger toys lost its tail and the parent will say to the child don't make such a fuss it's only the tail you know it doesn't matter it's only the tail of a toy for the child when you're two maybe that tail is everything right so careful because we just don't know how others are kind of taking things particularly very small people um and um and it's very very subjective um on that note time is scking by um so what I really want to say is an enormous thank you to all of you for for coming by I want to thank my editor uh a man called Simon prer who works at Penguin Books he is a genius among Publishers um I'll tell you why he publishes more people who for a long time no one's ever heard of until they become Superstars for years Simon prer published a writer called Bernardine evaristo who's one of the most famous writers in Britain now win prizes etc for years Simon published Bernardine and no one noticed and Simon said this person is worthwhile for years he published a writer called Ali Smith one of the most distinguished amazing writers in Modern English literature no one read her for years and Simon said this author matters why am I mentioning Simon Simon is an example of a man with a true self right he has to work within a publishing conglomerate he's got bosses Etc basically he gets a hunch and he sticks with it because somewhere in Simon's past sorry Simon to think about your childhood someone probably said yeah your intuition is right he was able to hang on to his true self and that's how he publishes and um I'm immensely grateful my whole career is really owed to a few others too but um was really owed to to Simon and it was he who said you could take some of these um uh uh uh ideas from the school of life you could put them in a book so thank you Simon for um for uh making a therapeutic Journey possible and um thank you to all my colleagues at the school of life for doing what they do it's an institution that day and day out helps people in therapeutic ways come and visit us you see us find Us online schoolof life.com um and um if you get this book hope you enjoy it um and I hope in some way it jogs your mind on a therapeutic Journey thank you also to everybody at the howto Academy for making um tonight possible most of all thank you to you thanks"

    "Title": "How To Stop Worrying",
    "Transcript": "We spend a lot of our lives worrying but one of the basic things we almost never remember to do is to go back and check how our worries fared against reality. For example, one week, we might be worried about running out of money; the next of being sued by a contractor at work; the third about having offended a friend, the fourth of being brought down by a rumour on social media and the fifth about leaving out something key from our tax returns. The worries go on and on, shifting relentlessly from one target to another - ruining our precious time on earth in the process. What we seldom ever get around to doing - once the event is past - is pausing to compare the scale of the worry with what actually happened in the end. We are too taken up with the next topic of alarm ever to return for a composed audit. Nevertheless, if we force ourselves to perform one, a strange realisation is likely to dawn on us: our worries are nearly always completely - and deeply - out of line with reality. Extended out across a year, a 'worry audit' is liable to yield similar conclusions. We almost lost our minds to worry but we didn't - in the end - run out of money, the conflictual work situation found a sound resolution, our friend wasn't offended and so on. We might fairly say that only 1% of all the things we ever worry about seem to reach the levels of awfulness we are solidly convinced - in anticipation - that they possess. Mark Twain's famous dictum comes to mind: 'I have lived through many disasters; only a few of which actually happened'. We should - far more than we do - use the reams of data about the unreliability of our fears as a guide to the future. If we got it so wrong in the past, we're highly likely to get it rather wrong now too. Of course we're convinced - yet again - that this is really and truly the end, but such a certainty was with us on a great many other situations which we appear to have sailed through well enough. Perhaps the world is not - for all its dangers - as awful as we presume. Perhaps most of the drama is ultimately unfolding in a place we need to explore and heal as fast as we can: our minds."

    "Transcript": "There are those who make it - and those who won't. And yet it can be troublingly hard - from the outside at least - to understand why, even though the matter is one of the most urgent for anyone reflecting on love and their chances of succeeding at its run of complexities. What we can know for sure is that it won't be about luck Couples who make it will, on frequent occasions, have looked very much as if they wouldn't. They will have despaired, slammed the door, packed a suitcase and walked to the station. But they won't have boarded the train, not because they weren't sorely tempted, but because at the last minute they remembered something key about human beings: that everyone is in the end pretty much as awful as everyone else. They didn't allow themselves to get overly idealistic about strangers. They understood that the difficulties they were facing would be those that would necessarily unfold with pretty much anyone they could be with, in one form or another. They accepted that we all intrinsically flawed, out-of-control disturbed creatures, mired in madness, error and confusion - and generally worthy more of compassion than fury. They lost the will to believe in that most tender and destructive of illusions: flawless love. Lovers who wind up sticking around are those who can suppose, after a three-day-long argument followed by a week long sulk, that neither their partner nor they are ultimately especially dreadful - only averagely and typically so. They become each other's best friend rather than upbraiding, angry angel. They recognise they are trying to do something extremely complicated together - and block their ears to society's malicious suggestion that it might ever be easy."

    "Title": "Why is everyone so worried about 'Narcissism'?",
    "Transcript": "Narcissism is one of the more misunderstood terms of our time. We're so aware of the bad narcissist - one whose overweening pride leaves them no room for empathy or kindness - that we are at risk of missing the central role that narcissism should play in the development of any healthy human. None of us is able to thrive without a chance to deeply like ourselves. As psychotherapy recognises, we universally require a dose of what is termed 'healthy narcissism', a sense of our lovability and rightful place in the world bequeathed to us via the approbation of kindly and enthusiastic care-givers in our early years. In our haste to condemn selfishness and pride, we miss out on the primordial importance of self-esteem and confidence generated by love. If we analyse his situation from a clinical point of view, the mythic Narcissus didn't get fixated on his reflection to the exclusion of others because he loved himself too much; a good deal more poignantly, he did so because some form of early deprivation had bred in him a need to manically keep checking in on himself in a doomed search for a value he evidently couldn't believe in. Without adequate approval, we develop what is known as a 'narcissistic wound' - a feeling of profound inadequacy in relation to elements like our looks, our status or our intelligence. As wounded people, we will then keep being drawn - despite ourselves - to scenarios that scratch at our perceived flaws. We'll be alive to every criticism about us, we'll pick partners who can't reassure us and we'll anticipate - and thereby often precipitate - the end of anything positive or kind. We hear too much about a character who grows evil and selfish because they think too well of themselves. The reality is far more complex and sad. Everyone needs to be adored and will suffer immensely if they are not. We should strive to become more conscious of our narcissistic wounds and try to salve them through intense doses of the very same sort of love whose original absence created them. As we need to keep reminding ourselves, no one ever grew ill from too much love."

    "Title": "The Secret to a Calm Life",
    "Transcript": "We're likely to try out many sorts of lives before we land, finally, on the quiet variety. Rarely does anyone start there, the kind of life where we try to be in bed by ten and are intensely grateful when nothing has gone dramatically wrong in the preceding hours. First we might try out the life of fame, the sort where we dream that someone will stop us in a shop or train station and say, 'Aren't you…?' or 'Don't I know you from…' That is a not-negligible thrill, especially if you didn't feel too noticed in childhood and if, in adolescence, it was always someone else who was able to make people you loved smile. Or we might be drawn to the life of melodramatic relationships, the kind where we're constantly wondering whether they love us or we love them, where we break up every couple of weeks and are calling them, frantically, to come back from their parent's house and we didn't mean all those crazy words we said, we were just scared. It can take a lot of pain before we make our peace with so-called ordinariness and accept it for the wonder it is; before we can deeply love a day when we have 'nothing' to do other than wake up early, finish the dishes from last night, shower, read a few poems, answer some emails, maybe go to the museum to see some African masks or a canoe from Oceania, buy some bread, fry some eggs. We might become rather fierce at anyone and anything that threatens this hard-won achievement; at well-meaning people who invite us on complicated excursions or worrying parties; at newspapers that force us to think about driven types starting companies and releasing a new film or record. We know how much these stimulants can cost us. It takes great confidence to give up on being special. It takes kindness to oneself to interrupt the longing for suffering and anguish. One might have needed to try out almost everything else before realising, in the end, that it was calm we always really wanted."

    "Title": "How to Love without fear",
    "Transcript": "We regularly get into difficulties in love because we refuse to accept how much reassurance and stroking we need from the person we love. We imagine we're grown up, we don't want to countenance how fragile and easily wounded we might be, we don't want to see the always susceptible and sensitive child beneath the impressive adult. And so, in the face of 'small things' that have undeniably hurt us (a missing warm comment here, a lack of touch there), we go numb instead, we silently and swiftly pull up the drawbridge, we unconsciously prepare to recriminate, we tell ourselves that we have a lot of work to do and should spend more time by ourselves. The last thing we can acknowledge is that we might be sad, confused and secretly furious. It would help a lot if we could recognise with grace - helped in this by better societal sign-posting - that, when it comes to relationships, we are all without a skin. We feel everything - whether we chose to register the fact or not. We're alive to every nuance in our partner's behaviour toward us; we notice and are pained by every piece of distance, every moment of incomprehension and every minor slight. It is obviously profoundly tempting to deny such exposure. Who wants to be constantly reminded that they have in effect forfeited their independence to the moods and inclinations of a wholly autonomous fellow human? How much more comforting to subsist under the illusion that we might be immune to minor slights and that our spirits remain substantially in our own hands. And yet it would be fairer and a good deal cleaner to accept that once we have are in love, we have no option but to feel everything that goes on between ourselves and a partner. We have to know on a daily, even hourly basis, that we continue to matter to them. It is no use pretending to be made of rock - of attempting to be recklessly, and eventually angrily and coldly, brave. We need to put in place measures to preserve love in the face of our ongoing vulnerability. We need regularly to check in with one another and ask: Have I hurt you? And then as regularly say: I still love you. It's no sign of being infantile to approach love with immense, almost implausible sensitivity. It's a sign that we've at last accepted what a grown up is and needs."

    "Title": "ART/ARCHITECTURE - Francisco Goya",
    "Transcript": "Francisco Goya, The sleep of reason produces monsters, 1799 The Spanish painter Francisco Goya is one of the outstanding artists of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Born into a middle-class family in 1746, in Fuendetodos in Aragon, he began painting young and was quickly recognised by his contemporaries for his genius. We acclaim him today for, among other works, his masterpieces, The Third of May 1808, his portrait of Charles IV and his family - as well as his series of unflinching prints, The Disasters of War. However, his most emotionally compelling work is a print he made in 1799, titled - hauntingly and evocatively - The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters. The title is central to the work. In case we were to miss it, it's even etched on the desk - and sounds yet more eloquent in Spanish. As Goya knew intimately (he'd been manic depressive since late adolescence), night is when things can become unbearable if our minds are fragile. What each of Goya's monstrous animals really is is a thought, a thought that can assail us when we are exhausted and depleted. Often, these night-time thoughts are an internalisation of the most awful messages we've ever heard from other people (probably those we grew up around): you are no good, you disgust me, don't you dare to outsmart me. The owl with outstretched wings might be shrieking: you will never achieve anything. The furry beaked bat might be hissing: your desires are revolting. The lynx-like thing at the bottom looks on with judgmentalness: I'm so disappointed in what you've become. During the day, when we feel so-called monsters hovering as we talk to a colleague or have dinner with friends, we can fend the animals off with rational arguments: of course we've done nothing wrong. There's no reason to keep apologising, we have the right to be. But at night, we can forget all our weapons of self-defence: why are we still alive, why haven't we given up yet? We don't know what to answer any more. To survive mentally, we might need to undertake a lengthy analysis of where each animal came from, what it feeds off, what makes it go on the prowl and how it can be wrestled to submission. One beast might have been born from our father's mouth, another from our mother's neglect; most of them get excited when we have too much work, when we're exhausted and when the cities we live in are at their most frenetic. And they hate early nights, nature and the love of friends. We need to manage our monsters - each of us has our own version - with all the respect we owe to something that has the power to kill us. We need to build very strong cages out of solid kind arguments against them. At the same time, we can take comfort from the idea that the night-time monsters will get less vicious the more we can lead reasonable, serene lives. With enough gentleness and compassion, we can hope to reach a point when, even in the dead of night, as these monsters chafe at their collars and strike at their bars, we will remember enough about ourselves to be unafraid and to know that we are safe and worthy of tenderness. Goya's print isn't just an evocation of night terror: it's also pointing us - more hopefully - to how we might in time tame our monsters through love and reason."

    "Title": "The Power of Simplicity",
    "Transcript": "It can take a very long time indeed to work up the courage to be simple: to read simple books, to wear simple clothes, to have simple days and to say simple things. For a long time, all the advantages and glamour seem to lie with complexity. We are pulled towards rare and hard-to-follow ideas; we entertain our friends with elaborate meals; we pursue convoluted relationships; we have careers that enmesh us in cumbersom commitments; we fill our leisure hours with exotic hobbies. And then at some point, we may sense and aspire to the real challenge of existence: to dare to sound - to some - like an idiot; to fix on certain basic truths we've always known, to edit down our calendars, to wear only what is comfortable, to put in front of others the same sort of basic foods we like when we're alone, to have relationships solely with those who know how to be direct, to leave our days more or less free apart from one or two elementary pleasures (tending to a garden, having a bath, going for a walk), to limit our reading to books we can understand and to communicate without inhibition all those heartfelt and essential things we know to those we are close to (that they are everything to us and that we'll miss them immensely when it is over). We worry inordinately about sounding boring or silly were we to show ourselves without elaboration or live according to our own less adorned inclinations. We spend the major part of our lives trying - unsuccessfully - to be somebody else. It can be the thought of death that eventually loosens us from our pretensions. We realise - under its bracing influence - that there is no point burdening ourselves with habits, ideas, vocabularies, people and duties that don't belong to us. There is no point wasting time we can ill afford on those who can't non-defensively say 'I love you', with clothes that we can't keep clean, with books we can't understand and with crowded days heavy with panic and meaningless challenges. We finally lose our terror of coming across as a simpleton and a yokel. We'll be properly mature, properly sophisticated even, we'll probably have had to go through a host of complications, by the time we learn to appreciate the art of being direct, easy to follow, emotionally straightforward, predictable, unhurried and - in the eyes of the frantic and impressionable many - exceptionally dull."

    "Title": "The 17 Secrets to a Successful Relationship",
    "Transcript": "It's often said that no one can ever really say what a good relationship is, let alone draw up a checklist for a prospective one. We politely disagree: 1. Pick someone you feel profoundly grateful ever decided to look your way. Start from a sense that you are the lucky one - and that they are superior (the truth is irrelevant). 2. Make sure you fancy them. Check out that you have compatible areas of perversion - and little interest being normal in bed. 3. Allow yourselves both to admit, from an early stage, that you are 'mad'; heavily distorted by your pasts, unable to understand yourselves, prone to irrational assumptions - and unsteady in your assessments of reality. 4. Make apology the most regular of occurrences. Say sorry about everything all the time and reduce the price of an admission to almost zero. 5. Remove all pride from your character. You were an idiot then, you are an idiot now, you will be an idiot tomorrow. There's no other option for a human being. Make jokes. 6. Regularly explore how you have disappointed one another. Let them sometimes hate you and you them. Don't be frightened by anger moderately expressed. The enemy of love is stifled emotion, not maturely explored authenticity. Listen very carefully when they tell you how they feel. 7. Never describe them categorically as this or that (insulting trait). Only ever say: I feel you are this or that… Observe the difference. 8. Get good at sensing the fear beneath your angry moods, then express the fear gently rather than acting out the anger. 9. Reduce expectations of perfection. It's going to get horrible at times. Allow for major frustrations. You will want to kill them and they you. Don't. 10. Accept you will have crushes on others. Let them wash over you - and, if the mood is right, share them with the partner. 11. If there are children, recognise that love will suffer hugely. Look forward to properly picking up the baton again in 15 years. 12. Become the sort of person who has no embarrassment about being 'needy.' Accept the child in you and look after their needs in the relationship. 13. Read up about attachment theory - and keep the concepts close at hand. 14. Stop being defensive; stop needing to maintain a proud hold on your own dignity. Laugh continually at your foolishness - and apologise for it. 15. Accept that they can't save you from your own disturbances. Try to be happy in yourself and if you are not, don't redirect the blame. Observe how often your rocky patches are projected versions of your own life crises. Get a therapist. 16. Don't expect everything from love. 17. Be very prepared (though reluctant) to leave. Remain out of choice, never desperation."

    "Title": "How to have a Transcendental Experience",
    "Transcript": "A 'transcendental experience' - from the Latin transcendere, meaning 'to go beyond' - denotes a brief, uncommon, ecstatic and revelatory period in which we are able to loosen our hold on our characteristically narrow ego-specific concerns and can identify with a totality that is larger, older, greater, deeper than we are - and feel intensely unburdened and liberated thereby. We might have a transcendental experience early on a summer's morning, looking at the mist starting to burn up in the valley below us; or late at night with the galaxies above us; we might go through one in a plane crossing the icefields of northern Canada or at 3am, alone in a foreign hotel bedroom, contemplating matters from a new unbound perspective. Nature is especially good at prompting transcendental moments as are nights, solitude, the sounds of flutes, sitars and harps, airplanes, fevers, William Blake, Rumi, mountains and psilocybin and mescaline. In the grip of a transcendental experience, it matters very slightly less who we are, the mistakes we have made, and how halting our uncertain trajectory has been. We willingly let go of the compromised 'I' and all its often petty and mean-spirited obsessions in order to become, for a privileged while, a part of the timeless, beatific whole. We are the clouds, the rocks, the beetle climbing arduously up the bark of a tree, a baby being born on another continent, a nonagenarian breathing their last, a line in a poem and a star expiring in a distant galaxy. We don't care that we have been betrayed in love, were defeated at work and roughly handled in childhood. Our own death becomes a matter of utter indifference, we feel honoured to be occupying such a small space in the order of things and that we will soon disappear without a trace. We let go of it all in the name of an identification with the totality of existence. We willingly exchange ourselves for engulfment in otherness. We have not gone mad. We'll be doing the school run or the accounts again in a few hours. But what counts is that we have accessed - and can now bookmark - a kind of experience that will always be on hand in memory as a rebuke to our most frantic, frightened or vain moments. It is the greatest privilege accorded to us by our complex minds that we do not always have to be simply and punishingly ourselves."

    "Title": "How to change your Script",
    "Transcript": "Unfortunately for everyone, we go around the world with scripts in our minds. A script is a collection of expectations about how events will unfold and how we should best respond to them - built up out of the worst moments of our childhoods and our most immature and frightened deductions therefrom. Here are some representative scripts: When I make a mistake… I will get shouted at uncontrollably. Therefore I must never admit I'm at fault. When I trust someone… they betray me. Therefore I must never open up. If I get too emotional, there will be chaos. Therefore I must be very stern and detached. If a partner is out of contact for a while… it means they've abandoned me. Therefore I need to flare up at any threat of absence. These scripts tell us a lot about our pasts, but the tragedy is that, unaware they exist, we let them determine our futures. We insistently layer them onto situations in the here and now that could have had far more benevolent endings. A boss very gently points out a mistake and, out of a fear that this is a prelude to relentless humiliation, we snap back. Our partner lets us down in a minor way and, sure this means they are about to destroy us, we start to insult them. The solution is to recognize that there can be different endings. Yes, I made a mistake, but the result doesn't have to be cruel reprimand. Yes, the partner let me down, but they can - and do - still love me very much. I could get annoyed, but the emotion doesn't have to escalate uncontrollably. In other words, what happened originally doesn't have to keep happening. But only if we can first understand what actually happened. And to help us with this, we should explore the past by completing the following sentences: When I make a mistake…, When I trust someone…, If I get too emotional…, If a partner has to be out of touch for a while… The end goal of maturity might be defined as the ability to approach as much of life as possible life without a script."

    "Title": "The Only Two Questions to Repair a Relationship",
    "Transcript": "How can we prevent our relationships get damaged? Every day brings with it small challenges - disappointments, frustrations, and irritations - that can come between even the most committed partners and subtly wear away at the sincerity of their connection. To prevent this risk, lovers should regularly make room to ask themselves - in a calm spirit of gentle openness and curiosity - two ostensibly simple yet hugely central and effective questions: What are you angry with me about? And secondly, How have I scared you recently? Without meaning to, we are constantly angering our partners by not being more of who they would hope us to be. It is critical that the anger that has arisen can be divulged and heard. So in answer to the first question, we might explain how we are 'angry' that our partner's friends are so boring, that they don't have a better job, that they leave the kitchen untidy or that they worry so much about their mother. And they might get similarly angry with us that we are so nervous, and bad tempered, that we've been a stickler for manners and that we judge others so harshly. We need not get angry while we divulge our anger. The mood can be serene and even playful. We don't need solutions or magical answers either. What counts is that we have a chance to let go of our let-downs in an atmosphere of understanding and mutual apology. Then, to turn to the second question, love can be subtly throttled by fear. And that's why we should ask, How have I scared you recently? We scare each other all the time. By being unreasonable, by being messy, by being unreliable… Fear erodes the trust that the small vulnerable version of ourselves who lurks within us needs from someone in whom they chose to invest. There is a little child in us looking for a safe mummy or daddy, and who probably privately recoiled when our partners raised their voice with us or didn't come home when they said they would. Once more, what matters isn't that we never cause an upset but that we should hear a lover out politely when they tell us sweetly we have done so. We should stop denying our relationships the routine maintenance we don't hesitate to accord to a boiler or outboard engine. We don't have to dread the mysterious end of relationships so long as we can regularly muster the courage to accept how much we may have angered and frightened those whom we are committed to loving."

    "Title": "How to recognise your patterns - and escape them",
    "Transcript": "It sounds odd to say that we might be locked within a story. What might this curious expression mean? Chiefly that we keep unknowingly repeating dynamics that go in very particular - and not especially pleasant - directions. We're involved in stories of defeat, humiliation, suffering, fear and loneliness, believing ourselves to be original at every turn while in fact rehearsing almost identical patterns in our choices and behaviours. And we probably do this in two areas above all: our working lives and our love lives. At work, some of the stories might go like this: - Every time I succeed, I fall prey to terror that others will want to destroy me out of envy - and sabotage myself before they have a chance to ruin me We can get locked in a story where we strive hard to 'win' but the moment we do so, we grow fearful of enemies, either real or presumed, taking their vengeance out on us and stripping us of our advantages. It ends up easier to fail at a time of our own choosing than to live in anticipation of random destruction at the will of others. - I end up playing the helpful friend to a more powerful self-involved person who eventually takes all the glory for my efforts. According to this story, we play a meak subservient character who smiles a lot, who listens more than they speak and who winds up unrecognised and marginalised by our dominant friend, whom we have helped to triumph in ways we never do. Comparable sorts of stories might be going on in our love lives. For example: - I am drawn to emotionally unavailable people whose love I relentlessly try to secure According to this story, we repeatedly find ourselves 'in love' with people who are either unable to love us back at all or do so in a distracted or half-hearted way (maybe they are very cold or involved with someone else). Whenever an alternative story rears its head, a story involving someone kind and present, we make sure it will be refused and destroyed. We wonder - sincerely - why love can't be any easier. - I get into relationships with good people who I betray with random strangers - and then lament being abandoned In this story, we begin love stories with kind and good people who we find ourselves drawn to hurting through affairs we're not aware of actively seeking but that we can't resist getting into. Our stories are guaranteed to end in loss and sadness. Why are we such addicts of these sorts of painful stories? As we can guess, because they play out in our adult present the essence of scenarios that unfolded in substantially similar ways in childhoods that we have neither understood nor liberated ourselves from at the hands of our caregivers. Once upon a time, the characters that are now played by our co-workers or people we meet on dating sites were played by Mother or Father, in scripts we have lost sight of. We repeat a narrative because specific sorts of pain and unfulfillment feel seductively familiar and because we privilege familiarity over happiness. We have an impression that a story 'should' go a certain way, towards darkness, while joy and satisfaction give off a feeling of eerieness and illegitimacy. Liberation comes when we can dare to start an audit of our narrative choices. To help us, we might sketch out the last few relationships or workplace fiascos and see what similarities there might be between them. Who left who and why? Where was the pain coming from? How did we act? And how might this be a palimpsest of what happened somewhere long ago? If we keep being involved in stories of betrayal at work, we can be almost certain that there was once a betrayal that we haven't understood or overcome. If we keep needing to throw ourselves at the feet of unavailable people, there is someone's love we once needed and which we have never faced up to not having won. We need to go back and refind the original actors or we will never be left off the stage. We'll keep following the same fruitless trajectories until we can better understand why we began them - and, through an awareness of our distinctive roles, give ourselves the opportunity, at last, for different sorts of endings."

    "Title": "The Secret Power of Unsent Letters",
    "Transcript": "A general principle of mental health is that the less we are able to express, the more unwell we get it. It's when we have to stifle our rage, sadness, or fear that we start to develop secondary symptoms - sleeplessness, paranoia, bitterness, poor digestion - just as our spirits can lighten and our horizons expand once we can find a way to lend outward form to our pains. However, the problem is often one of occasions. We may in theory be ready to say and feel all sorts of things but our outward circumstances may be highly unconducive to free expression. Perhaps the person we'd like to say something to is dead or they may - just as grievously - be distracted, fragile or frightening. We then make the error of imagining that there can be no point in speaking - and on this basis stifle our emotions to our increasing cost. But this is to miss out on an unexpected quirk of our psyches. What may matter most in many situations is not, as we might think, that the person we need to speak to is actually able to hear what we have to say; but rather that we have a proper, in-depth chance to say it any way. There can be as much benefit in shouting our feelings to a deserted beach, a large pillow or an empty chair as there would be in having a lengthy dialogue with an intimidating parent or an obtuse lover. The best technique in this tradition may be to write a letter that we never send (either because the person in question is no longer alive or because we have no expectation that what we write could remotely be understood). The discipline of writing a long letter has the effect of galvanising our hitherto confused and disparate emotions and forces our intelligence to lay out our story in a systematic and emotionally logical way. As we write, we turn what might have been an inchoate sob into something intelligible, plausible, compassion-inducing and moving. We go from 'I hate you so much…' or 'Why why why' to a full recap of how we felt, why we suffered and what the legacy of our injury has been. We can be the grown up lawyer making a case in a courtroom of adults on behalf of a frightened or muddled child. We can take our absent reader into the details of a story that they refused to see existed and may have done their best to silence. We are giving ourselves an opportunity to feel legitimate in our own eyes. We realise that the real audience we needed all along was ourselves. We suffer unnecessarily when we think that the only form of catharsis is one that can unfold in the physical presence of a person who damaged us. Our freedom is - fortunately - far greater than this, because the real sceptic we need to win over and explain our full story too is chiefly and crucially always ourselves."

    "Transcript": "Relationships suffer from a fundamental tension between the desire to be honest and the fear of being abandoned. We go into relationships in order to be 'ourselves' but were we to really be entirely ourselves, there is a high risk we would be left. Silence seems the price we have to pay for companionship. However much we may claim to be open minded, very few of us genuinely make room for another's complexity in so far as we are its targets. We say they can 'tell us anything' but in practice the topics any of us are really prepared to listen to is small - and lovers unconsciously mutually know it. Tell me who you really are - just leave out most of the details. How quickly most relationships would end if one were to say: I love you but sometimes I'd like to have an affair… Or: sometimes I catch you from a certain angle and I despise you... Or: sometimes for a while I wish you weren't in my life. Or: sometimes you bore me. Or: your flaws have been driving me to despair. And yet, while saying something like this puts a relationship at risk, saying nothing is not unproblematic either. We can't go through love being simply 'polite.' Our entire emotional system goes numb when we have to keep a lid on a gigantic lie. Emotions that haven't been expressed tend to end up being acted out. We can't easily either say nothing - or something. It would help hugely if society were to give us a better picture of love that prepared us at a collective level - way before this or that lover was in question - for the legitimacy of ambivalent feelings, including anger, disappointment and disloyalty. And reassured us that we didn't need to panic at such feelings' occasional emergence, that they were likely to pass and were generally just a sign of two people getting very close. The greatest favour we can pay our lovers is to allow them (so long as there is never contempt or violence in the mix) to hate us a lot sometimes. The people who are the experts at this are parents of three year olds. When a small child says, 'Mummy, or Daddy, I hate you a lot today,' parents do what we should all generally do: they manage not to take it personally. They understand instinctively that love is very complicated, they don't hold honesty against a person whom they know is fundamentally good and kind, they know the mood will alter and - most importantly - they remember how often they have felt exactly the same."

    "Transcript": "The American writer James Baldwin first went to Paris in 1948, as a 24 year old, and was to stay in the city for much of the next nine years - and in France intermittently until his death in 1987. Baldwin had felt asphyxiated in America: his family had expectations of him he hated, his friends were judgemental. He felt observed and intruded upon. Society was moralistic and prurient. As a result, he couldn't be creative or free and had the sense of being watched and commented upon all the time; it was like being always at school - or in prison. So he undertook that most inwardly liberating of moves: he went into exile. From Paris, it no longer mattered what 'they' were saying. Public opinion could appear, as it always should have done, parochial and absurd. No one knew him in the French capital. They had never heard of his family. It was as if he had - in a good way - died and been granted a chance of a second unsigned life. In France, he could create, take risks, dress differently, make unusual friends - and become himself. Crucially, Baldwin had no interest whatsoever in assimilating into French society. He wasn't looking to swap one narrow village for another. It was exile he was after - that very particular state in which one is free not to belong anywhere in particular, to escape all tribes in order to be unobserved, anonymous and detached. It may not always be possible for us to become actual exiles, but we should at the very least strive to become internal exiles, that is, people who can behave like visitors in their own lands, no longer bound by local idiocies, able to cut themselves off from the mean and restricted views of so-called friends or disloyal families, and to grow indifferent to provincial competition and grandstanding. Baldwin and his fellow exiles are there to remind us how much we long to be free"

    "Title": "How to Deal with Negative Emotions: Daily Proven Techniques",
    "Transcript": "An unexpected and troublesome feature of being human is that we feel so much more than we spontaneously realise we feel. There are emotions coursing through of us - of anger or joy, resentment or fear - that lie just outside the sphere of ordinary consciousness and that elude us as we rush through the challenges of our lives. These emotions lie low in part because they are often too shocking or sad or contrary to expectations for us to want to make sense of them. We might hate where we are supposed to love; or may feel sad where we are meant to be practical - and so, out of timidity and fear, we omit to register our authentic reality. Or else our feelings get ignored because they enter our minds too fast, and in too great a quantity for us to disentangle them in the limited time we devote to self-understanding. And yet unless the full panoply of our emotions is regularly identified and adequately 'felt', we are likely to fall prey to a range of psychological ills: anxiety, paranoia, depression and worse. Mental unwellness is born out of an accumulation of unfelt feelings. We must do ourselves the favour of regularly - ideally once a day - carving out periods in which to get more deeply acquainted with our true emotions. We must continually ask ourselves a simple-sounding but grand and deep question: What am I feeling now? To draw out valuable answers, we should sit somewhere quiet, probably in bed, with the lights low, and a pad and pen handy. We should close our eyes and let the generosity and free-form nature of the question resonate. After a few moments of scanning the penumbra of the inner mind, we are liable to pick up a few intimations of something. It might be the rustle of a disturbingly well-camouflaged anxiety. With some of the stealth of a hunter in the undergrowth or a fisherman by the bank of a river, we can press ourselves to reflect further: what does it seem we are actually anxious about? It may require a good deal more reverie and inner enquiry before we very gradually feel a recognisable notion emerging, like a landscape subtly appearing at the slow break of a summer day. We may need to decode apparently minute moments of aggression, meanness, confusion or grief that have impacted on us without us properly noticing. Or we might, as we examine ourselves, detect traces of ancient traumas that seem to be still active in distant valleys: someone is crying, someone is very worried, a small person - who might be us - needs our help quite badly. We should carry out a similar process with our bodies, where many more muted feelings lie buried. 'What is my body feeling?' we can ask, strangely but usefully. 'What would it like to talk to me about?' And to get more specific: 'If my shoulders could speak right now, what might they say? And my chest, what would it say? And my arms, my hands, my legs, my feet?' Our limbs might want to curl into a ball and long for reassurance, or else hit an opponent or elongate themselves defiantly and boldly. Or they might remember an old frustrated wish to be held on a comforting chest. Through ten or twenty minutes of this kind of concentrated, but loose and exploratory wander through ourselves, we reduce the worry and sorrow of unfelt feelings. We become sad where we were previously melancholy, angry where we were irritable and compassionate where we were anxious - and the result is a newfound peace of mind and lightness of the soul. We seem to have so much time for everything - except for what can save us."

    "Title": "How to Make Love Last Forever",
    "Transcript": "When relationships start, enthusiasm for our partners is typically natural and intense. We think of them constantly, we want only to spend more time in their company, we delight in their many skills and accomplishments: but this early phase of powerful admiration and longing rarely lasts. The world often explains this cooling as an inevitable result of sheer exposure. It is, they say, typical to neglect what is always around. But the true reasons seem more complicated, more psychologically rich and, in their own way, a lot more hopeful. If we stop admiring, it is chiefly because we are, at some level, furious. Anger destroys admiration. We cease to love because we unknowingly grow entangled in various forms of unprocessed fury. We can't cheer the partner on because, somewhere deep inside, we are inhibited by trace memories of certain letdowns, large and small, of which they have been guilty. Perhaps they caused us immense difficulties around an examination - and never apologised. Maybe they flirted with a friend of ours - and refused to admit to the fact in a way that left us tricked and unsure. They may have have booked a holiday without asking us - and then insisted that they'd done nothing wrong. Every infraction was not, on its own, necessarily always particularly serious, but taken cumulatively, a succession of minor disappointments can acquire a terrible capacity to dampen and ultimately destroy love. Yet it is not the simple fact of being let down that counts very much, the true problem comes about when there hasn't been an opportunity to process our disappointment. Irritation is only ever toxic when it can't be rapidly and thoroughly discussed. Perhaps we tried to explain what was wrong but we got nowhere. Or, more subtly, we might have felt unentitled to make a fuss over so-called 'small things' and therefore said nothing, even though, in our depths, the small things mattered immensely to us. With great unfairness to our partner, we may have forgotten to admit to our own sensitivities even as we developed a steady burden of resentment on their account. What follows from such buried anger is something that can be mistaken for disinterest. We're not so keen on celebrating their birthday, we withhold sexual attention, we don't look up when they walk in a room. This could seem like the normal impact of time and familiarity. But it is no such thing. It is evidence of cold fury. We do our anger an honour, and can start to dismantle its deleterious impacts, when we recognise the distinctive stranglehold that frustration can acquire on our emotions. We never simply go off people; we only ever get angry with them. And then forget we are so. To refind our instinctive enthusiasm for our partner, we need to accurately locate our suppressed distress. We have to allow ourselves to be legitimately upset about certain things that have saddened us and properly raise them - for as long as we need to - in a way that lets us feel acknowledged and valued. A good couple should allow for regular occasions when each person can - without encountering opposition - ask the other to listen to stories of incidents, large or small, in which they felt let down of late. It goes without saying that we might not immediately see why a given thing should matter so much to our partner; but that isn't the point. The objective of the exercise is just to let the partner know that we care about whatever they happen to be concerned about. To ensure that our desire never suffers, this kind of hygienic ritual might unfold as often as once or twice a week. If couples too often ignore the requirement, it is because they operate under an unfair burden of bravery: they assume that it cannot be sane to want to make a complaint about things that given off an impression of being minor and so stay silent about their upsets until it is simply no longer possible for them to love. Wiser couples know that nothing should ever be too small to cover at length - for what is at ultimately at stake in a marathon conversation about a single word or event can be the fate of the entire relationship. It might, in a similar spirit, not be silly at all to devote an entire evening to understanding why a partner got silently immensely upset by the way we said the word 'ready' to them at breakfast the day before or was a little slow at laughing at a mildly unfunny anecdote about a train and a suitcase. The gratitude that will flow from such an effort to understand them will be amply repaid the next time we feel abandoned because they forgot to put the lid back on the olives or omitted to add a second x at the end of an email. To complain in love is a noble and honourable skill very far from the whininess with which it is sometimes confused. The irony of well-targeted and quickly raised complaints is that their function is so very far from negative. Honesty is a love-preserving mechanism that keeps alive all that is impressive and delightful about our partner in our eyes. By regularly voicing our small sorrows and minor irritations, we are scraping the barnacles off the keel of our relationship and so ensuring that we will sail on with greater joy and admiration into an authentic and unresentful future."

    "Title": "The Key Ideas of Hinduism",
    "Transcript": "Most world religions and philosophies make the cardinal error of supposing that what they see as the meaning of life should — by virtue of its importance — apply to everyone, irrespective of age, circumstance or position. So proud are they of their insight into existence, they can't help but accord it universal and dogmatic application. Hinduism is a great deal more supple and imaginative. It too has a sense of how a good life should be lived, but crucially, it never assumes that the rules should apply across the board. It cuts up populations into segments — and differentiates right conduct according to four life stages collectively called 'ashramas.' The first of these ashrama is termed 'brahmacharya' and covers the period of life when one is a child and a student. Here — however serious life might be overall — one is allowed to play, to be tender and to give free reign to the imagination. But one must also learn and obey. Then, more arduously, comes the stage when one becomes a 'grihasta' or householder: this is the time for maximal involvement in practical matters. There might be little time for prayer or contemplation; it's the moment for building up capital, for buying a house, developing a profession and having a family of one's own. The stage might last twenty years or more. But eventually, practical obligations recede, children grow up and leave home and it is time to become a 'vanaprastha' or 'forest walker': someone who can increasingly surrender practical tasks and reorient themselves to the spiritual realm by going for walks — ideally (and poetically) in mango forests. Then lastly, when we are truly done with business and when family life has ceased to make all but the most minor calls on us, we are allowed to enter the stage of 'sannyasa', where we renounce worldly goods, don a simple robe and wander the world in search of ultimate sources of enlightenment, charity and spiritual friendship. We may not agree with every detail of the way Hinduism carves up a life, but we can admire the imaginative way in which it seeks to align its teachings with the particular demands of society, the body and the family across time. It would — knows Hinduism — be as absurd to entice an 18 year old to do yoga for six hours a day while contemplating the absolute as it would be to spend all one's time in business meetings as a 70 year old. There is a time for 'moksa' — the striving to liberate oneself from the cycle of eternal life — and there is a time for 'artha' — when we must head to the office and sound serious during company presentations; both are, in their respective contexts, equally legitimate and equally important. We are reminded that there is no simplistic unitary goal to life. We shouldn't ask ourselves what the right way to live is per se; it all depends on where on the journey we happen to be."

    "Title": "Why You Aren't Sleeping (and How to Fix It)",
    "Transcript": "Sometimes we are just thirsty or too hot, but most often our insomnia is psychological. It is the mind's revenge for all the efforts we have, largely unbeknownst to us, been making not to have certain thoughts in the day. We are being woken up by a need to think about something that we have assiduously been ignoring, probably thanks to our work, or our social and family commitments. Having attempted to get our attention by more normal means in the clamour of the day, our deep minds are now trying to get us to have an appointment with certain insights in the quieter hours of night. Our 3am awakenings are signs that we have repeatedly not been doing the sort of self-reflection we need to do in order to be at peace. We are not being lazy; we are not shunning our responsibilities out of wilfulness. We are simply escaping, for very understandable reasons, from what are liable to be a range of difficult thoughts, perhaps about work, a relationship, or our childhoods. If we are to regain sleep, we should begin to visit - with greater tenderness and imagination than we allow ourselves in the day - some of the bolted and locked rooms of our mind. In a spirit of gentle curiosity, protected by our duvet, under the care of darkness, we might dare to raise certain sorts of enquiry: - What am I truly, truly sad about at the moment? - Who has hurt me? - What needs to change? - What is the real grief beneath the surface anxiety? - What is my gut telling me I need to know now? - And do next? These are uncomfortable questions no doubt, but we can use the night to help us to face them. Everyone else is asleep. It matters a little less now that we think in conventional ways. We can be odd, fanciful, imaginative and kind. We can go a little mad between 3 and 4am and no one will ever need to know. We can write things down in a notebook and destroy the pages in the morning. What counts is that we give ourselves the chance to understand our shy and pained psyches a little better. They have been crying out for our attention and we have - till now - run away from our duty of care. Our minds' ultimate responsibility is to our growth and self-understanding. They want us to sleep of course, they understand as well as any expert that rest is important, but they have as a priority something even more important than energetic limbs: psychological insight. They need us to have felt what needs to be felt, to have been angry where we are in a rage, to be sad where we are grief stricken. They are irrepressibly driven to try align our surfaces with our depths. They are trying to send us to the School of Night, not to be unkind, but so that we can catch up on some very key lessons about who we really are that we have until now been too distracted or squeamish to attend."

    "Title": "The Life Changing Effect of Small Talk With Strangers",
    "Transcript": "Taking time to have small chats about nothing in particular with people we don't know and are unlikely ever to meet again can - from some perspectives - seem like the height of absurdity. Maybe we're in a coffee shop and someone is preparing us a drink. Perhaps we've crossed a neighbour in the hallway while getting our post. Or we're on a train, waiting for the doors to open. Why would we bother to hold up our day for a few moments, given how many things we already need to do and how many good friends we have that we haven't seen in far too long? We may also have a more high minded defence for our silence: we aspire to be profound people and there is no way that we can get anywhere meaningful with a near or complete stranger in a compressed amount of time. We shun the smaller chats because - in the back of our minds - we tell ourselves that we are already sufficiently deeply committed to the long and consequential ones. But this is to miss the point - and the opportunities - presented by minor social exchanges. They stand, in relation to lengthy friendships, rather as haikus do next to 1,000 page novels; there are things a tiny poem can do that a comprehensive narrative will miss. There are single sentences that can mark us as much as entire volumes. There are pictures that can stick with us in a way that a three hour film won't. We can be disproportionately and yet powerfully touched by so-called minor things. Small sympathetic chats matter above all because few of us are ever very far from sadness and vicious despondency. There are so many reason to dislike ourselves, to be paranoid about what other people think and to regret mistakes we've made. When we are in a febrile or fragile mood, a short kindly exchange can be all that is needed to start turn around a deeply dark day. An enormous amount of sympathy and fellow-feeling can be compressed in the most miniscule dialogue. 'They make them like that to torture us, don't they?' we might say to a parent struggling to close the zip on a child's jacket in a sudden downpour, thereby sending a modest sign that we know how difficult things can be - and that we have in some ways been there - or somewhere like there - ourselves. Or we might - on our way to a station - exchange one or two sympathetic words with a taxi driver about their elderly mother who, we learn, has just gone into a care home after having a fall. The chat won't change anything in an already tricky situation but the humanity on display might notch up another argument for hope. The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer remarked that we can never know for sure who around us may, at any particular moment, be thinking of ending their own life. The thought usefully puts into relief what might be at stake in any exchange; we may - at points and without any obvious warning - be the last thing between someone and a decision to despair. A charge often made against small chats is that we can surely only ever be 'pretending' to be friendly. Yet this is to miss out how much, and how deeply, our hearts may go out to people whose lives we merely brush against. We can imagine our way into pains whose details we will never know. We can - if it doesn't sound too paradoxical - love a stranger. And, even more oddly, for only a minute or two. We are - in all this - so often held back by unhelpfully grand ideas of what it means to be change the world. We imagine the requirements for improvement on such a large scale that - along the way - we end up grievously neglecting what it is actually in our powers to achieve right now, today, the next time we are out. We suffer from an upside down view of where significance can lie. We are assembled out of small things - and may live or die by their presence or absence. We have in our hands a very potent weapon already: the power to say a warm gentle sympathetic hello."

    "Title": "What Your Parents Made You Do for Love…",
    "Transcript": "The moment babies are born, their minds are dominated by a powerful implicit question: What do I need to do in order to be loved? We have to remember that babies are entirely at the mercy of the prevailing environment, and therefore, knowing what exactly the people in this environment want from them in exchange for keeping them alive is central to their very survival. Furthermore, how the question is answered will shape their entire personality and sense of adult priorities; who we are is predominantly the result of what we needed to do to capture and sustain the interest of the people who put us on the earth. There are broadly three answers to the baby's question. Let's go through them in turn: 1. Nothing very much A certain sort of parent immediately makes it clear: the baby doesn't need to do anything to deserve to exist. They are allowed to be; they don't need to do. Their own needs come first, who they are and what they want is the priority in those early fragile months and years. From such a base, a child can grow up liking themselves, being in touch with their needs and adjusting to the needs of others without too great a loss of creativity or individuality. They don't have to do anything extraordinary to feel they are OK; and if they happen to do it anyway, it will simply be out of a sense of inherent curiosity and appetite. This is, needless to say, the love we should all want - and have had. Then comes another kind of answer. 2. To earn love, you must succeed. For a certain kind of parent, the baby's existence is premised on an enormous requirement. The child has to help the parent to feel much better about themselves, they have to help them to paper over their own inadequacies, compromises and insecurities. For example, to ward off any risk the parent might be thought stupid, the child has to demonstrate extreme intelligence. To compensate for the parent's lack of stellar career, the child has to shine globally. To appease the parent's fear of ugliness, the child has to be blatantly pretty. To ward off fears of dullness and the pull of depression, the child needs to be a cheerful comic. The child is a compensatory object at the behest of the parent's disguised vulnerabilities. They are not allowed to be shy, hesitant, confused, quiet or unimpressive to strangers - for all this would devastate and madden an already precariously balanced parent. From such an upbringing, the child will be constantly be left wondering what they can do next to generate applause and acclaim. They will exhaust themselves in the pursuit of a love that should have been theirs from the first. Then there is a third kind of answer to the baby's question. 3. Some children have to succeed in order to be loved; some - even more darkly - are commanded to fail. There are parents who will only tolerate children who don't threaten their place in the world. They are not allowed to be any happier, more beautiful or more successful - and if they come anywhere close to being so, a vengeful aggression will make itself felt. The child understands well enough the rule they have been placed under. They can be expected to grow up with advanced tendencies to self-sabotage and underperformance. If they promise to be beautiful, they'll be sure not to take any pleasure in their physical appearance; if they are on track to do well at school, they'll ensure they manage always to fail the final exam. If they end up with a good career, they'll do their utmost to show their rivalrous parent that it isn't any fun really - perhaps by developing a psychological disorder that guarantees a demonstrable misery. Sometimes - even more perplexingly - more than one message emanates from a single parent. The parent swings between wanting a child to shore them up and fearing that they are threatening them. The child will be under pressure to both succeed and fail. There will be nowhere for the benighted soul to turn. What we can be sure is that anything other than the first message will leave us with a highly complex and unfortunate legacy. We need to be extremely compassionate towards ourselves and the babies we once were who heard such a puzzling and devastating answer to that powerless urgent first question: What do I need to do to be allowed to live?"

    "Title": "Carl Jung's Word Association Test",
    "Transcript": "One of the most significant discoveries of the early 20th century was of a part of the mind we now refer to as 'the unconscious.' It came to be properly appreciated that what we know of ourselves in ordinary consciousness comprises only a fraction of what is actually at play within us; and that a lot of what we really want, feel and are is not at our mental fingertips, lying instead in a penumbra of ignorance, fantasy and denial which we can only hope to dispel with patient and compassionate efforts, probably with the assistance of an analyst. Sigmund Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams, first published in Vienna in 1900, was the landmark study of the workings of this unconscious region, and detailed the mind's relentless attempts to hide a great many of its most salient truths from itself in the form of dreams - which might shock, disturb or excite us while they unfolded but would then be deliberately forgotten or misunderstood upon our waking. At much the same time, 700 kilometres to the west, over the border in Switzerland, another pioneering figure in early psychoanalysis, Carl Jung, took a complimentary but more direct and arguably more robust approach. Still only in his late twenties, Jung held a prominent position in Zurich's foremost psychiatric institution, the Burghölzli clinic and had understood that many of his patients were suffering from symptoms created by a conflict between what they deep down knew of themselves and what their conscious minds could bear to take on board about their feelings and desires. Someone might, for example, lose all ability to speak because of one or two things they so longed, but were so afraid, of communicating to particular people. Another might develop a terror of urinating because of a humiliation that they had suffered in childhood but that they lacked the wherewithal to remember and process. Following Freud, Jung believed that healing and growth required that we learn to untangle our mental knots and more fully appreciate our complicated, sometimes surprising yet real identities. Freud had concentrated on interpreting his patient's night-time visions and in listening to them speaking at length in unhampered ways on his therapeutic couch. Jung felt this took too much time and was too much at the mercy of the right chemistry between analyst and patient. Together with his colleague Franz Riklin, in 1904, he therefore developed what he took to be a more reliable technique which he termed the Word Association Test. In this, doctor and patient were to sit facing one another and the doctor would read out a list of one hundred words. On hearing each of these, the patient was to say the first thing that came into their head. It was vital for the success of the test that the patient try never to delay speaking and that they be strive to be extremely honest in reporting what they were thinking of, however embarrassing, strange or random it might seem. Jung and his colleague quickly realised that they had hit upon an extremely simple yet highly effective method for revealing parts of the mind that were normally relegated to the unconscious. Patients who, in ordinary conversation, would make no allusions to certain topics or concerns, would - in a word association session - quickly let slip critical aspects of their true selves. Jung grew interested in how long his patients paused after certain word prompts. Despite the request that they answer quickly, in relation to certain words, patients tended to grow tongue tied, unable to find anything they could say and then protesting that the test was silly or cruel. Jung did not see this as coincidental. It was precisely where there were the longest silences that the deepest conflicts and neuroses lay. A literal tussle could be observed between an unconscious that urgently wanted to say something and a conscious overseer that equally urgently wanted to stay very quiet indeed. In a given test, the doctor might say 'angry' and the patient might respond 'mother.' They would say 'box' and the patient might respond 'my life shut in one.' They might say 'lie' and the patient would respond 'brother.' And they might say 'money' and the patient, struggling with guilt and shame, might go silent for a very long time before saying they needed to get some air. Jung and Riklin published their research in a book called Diagnostic Association Studies. Written in dense scientific jargon, it comprises a succession of charts about what people answered in how long according to their ages, classes, genders and occupations. We are - unfortunately - unlikely to learn very much from the book today, but the interest of the underlying test lies less in the specific purpose for which Jung used it than in what it can more broadly suggest to us about ourselves when we turn to it in more intimate ways. Though it was made for a clinician to interpret, we may gain a huge amount from sitting the test on our own and analysing our responses and hesitations according to what we know of who we are. We may be ambivalent about self-knowledge but we are ultimately also in a pole position to make advances; in our more honest moments, we know rather a lot about where the bodies are buried. We can use Jung's hundred words as a provocative guide to regions of our experience that we have to date lacked the courage to explore - but that might hold the key to our future development and flourishing. And, of course, where we go blank and decide the test is really very silly, there we should pay the greatest attention."

    "Title": "Why Some Adults Can't... 'Act Their Age'",
    "Transcript": "Sometimes at moments of particular stress, one adult will turn to another and say: 'Stop behaving like a child.' Or even, 'Act your age.' This isn't merely rude - though it might be that too. In contact with given challenges, we revert back to an earlier stage in our development. We leave behind our adult faculties, the ones associated with reason, logic, calm, strength, forbearance and perspective, and slip very quickly into a child-like spectrum marked by panic, rage, despair, terror and appeasement. The specific occasions that shift us from adult to child are an individual guide to our own traumas. The reason why we behave like a child is that traumas selectively arrest development. A part of us will remain fixed at whatever age we become traumatised at; so though we may be 28 or 72, we will to all intents - in contact with a certain inflammatory situation - resemble the frightened, bewildered and ashamed 3 or 5 year old we once were - though we'll be unlikely to notice this. No bell goes off in the mind to signal, 'You're now shifting from being 32 to being 2.' The transition happens in a flash, and it's the work of years of therapy and self-exploration to be able to notice the shift and take measures to attenuate the damage. To guess at our original traumas, we need only to study triggering situations and generalise outwards from them. Let's imagine that we get very worked up about a difficulty at passport control with a stern officer or about a dispute with a neighbour who is threatening legal action because a tree we planted is blocking their view. When we erase away the local details, we may be able to see an elemental structure and can then ask ourselves questions accordingly: a powerful man is adopting a bullying manner towards us. Does this remind us of anything in the past? Or: we're suddenly being accused of having done something 'bad' that we had no idea about and the repercussions feel severe. Does this sound in any way familiar? Memories tend to emerge. That stern passport officer might map with eerie precision onto an extremely frightening father. Or a legal dispute might in its psychological fundamentals hint at at some awful bullying one suffered at school. When there is a certain kind of crisis, we should notice how fast we fall through the floors of adulthood, ten or twenty or forty years/storeys below the present to the child-like basement. A part of us needs to hold the other steady, see the hole blown in our minds by a triggering event - then ensure that we step carefully around the gap and take a seat somewhere very safe on the edge of the room, while we wait for reason to repair the damage. We're so afraid of patronising ourselves, we can find it hard to accept the bewildering way in which, in certain areas, we truly can be slammed back into being a frightened, panicky, perspective-less young version of ourselves. The floors in our minds may be prone to collapse at moments of stress; but knowing the hazard is more than half-way to a solution - and greater calm."

    "Transcript": "It feels natural, at times, to lament how boring our lives are. We do the same sorts of things each week, nothing special or exciting ever seems to happen. We enviously compare our dull routines to the adventures of others. An antidote to our sense of tedium can be found in the work of Sei Shonagon. Around a thousand years ago, she kept a journal of the decade or so she spent as a lady-in-waiting at the Imperial Place in Kyoto, then the capital of Japan. Despise the high-status of her job, her daily life was, externally, deeply uneventful: an afternoon's carriage ride outside the walls of the court compound might be the highlight of a year; a day trip to hear a sermon in a temple seems to have been the farthest extent of her travels; she spent all most all of her time indoors, in just two or three rooms; she saw the same few people month after month; her work largely involved keeping respectfully silent, knowing when to bow and remembering the complex titles of various officials. And yet The Pillow Book gives the impression that she had a wonderful time. We don't really know where the lovely title of the book came from; perhaps she slept with it under her head, occasionally adding a thought or observation by the light of the moon. Typically she asks herself questions, for instance: what is the nicest time of day? In the summer: it's the night, especially if it's raining; in Spring she prefers the dawn; in Autumn, sunset; in winter, the morning. An 'event' in her day includes observing the frost on the branches of a plum tree or enjoying the beating of the rain on the veranda roof. Such things don't sound very thrilling, but by concentrating on them and appreciating them, they become deep sources of satisfaction. Or she might ask herself: what is it fun to see? It might be someone who is usually very formal in their dress turning up looking a bit disheveled; a curtain at an open window billowing in the breeze; a cat walking easily along the top of a narrow railing; water droplets on leaves in the garde; porters cleverly maneuvering a big load that one would think would be impossibly cumbersome to carry; people whose clothes match the colour of the room they are in. She makes lists of words that sound intriguing, and of place names that sound romantic. She delights in describing little things that annoy her: someone who takes too long telling a good story; something clever she could have said, but didn't think of at the time; trying to get something done too quickly, making a mess of it and having to start all over again. As we read we might wish our life were as interesting as hers: and yet she is secretly sharing the technique that would make our own existence equally rich if we knew to ask ourselves more interesting questions. As with so many great books it leaves us not so much wanting to read it again as to start writing our own private version."

    "Transcript": "One of the stranger but more useful suggestions of psychotherapy - and in particular, a branch of it known as Transactional Analysis - is that all of us contain within ourselves three essential personalities: - a child - a parent - and an adult To flesh these out a little: The child is typically vulnerable, touching, trusting, weak, in need, incapable of properly looking after themselves and crying out for assistance, tenderness, support, structure and some rules. For their part, the parent is strong, dominant, in control, responsible but also often chiding, critical, hectoring - and busy from all their cares and duties. Meanwhile the adult is sane, thoughtful, in command, neither too weak nor too strong, creative and kind. In an ideal world, we would all be able to toggle between these three personality types with relative ease. In a good relationship, we would constantly be moving between all three roles in ourselves, mostly hovering in the adult zone, but able - when occasions demand this - to go into parent or child mode. For example, when we are feeling sad and under pressure, it should be part of health to know how to become a child again, to show our need, ask for help, curl into a ball, become small and trust that we can be met with kindness and sympathy without fearing attack or belittlement. Then again, there should also be moments in a relationship, particularly when our usually adult partner has hit a crisis and descended into a child like mode when we are powerfully able to step up into a parental role and become ministering, indulgent to weakness and tantrums, calm in the face of irrationality and secure enough in ourselves to know that the child partner will in a little while revert back to the maturity and self-command that we typically expect from them. If a couple have small children, then for long stretches, both may need to act as parent, but then once the kids are in bed, they might both have a go at being sweet slightly naughty children, or one might play adult to the other one's needy younger self. The difficulty - for couples and individuals - is when people get stuck in particular positions, when they can only ever be children, or only ever parents or only ever adults. There are relationships where, for example, one partner is always child and the other is always parent. One person is forever being a bit irresponsible, a bit naughty; they leave their clothes everywhere, they don't book in for a driving lesson, they don't go to the dry cleaner, they forget to do the shopping and they lose the keys. They can be highly endearing - when one is in the mood - but you'd hesitate a lot before leaving them in charge. And on the other side of the ledger, there is a parental type partner, who is always chiding, always reminding the child what to do, super competent, forever rather stressed, alternately indulgent to the child but also on the edge of being cross and punitive. Associated with this can be a deep reluctance on the part of the parental figure ever to access their child self. They always have to be strong, they always have to be mummy and daddy, they cannot go anywhere near being baby. Why, we might ask, do people - and therefore couples - get stuck in these roles? Why can it be so hard to move? Why are some people rigidly incapable of feeling their way into the role of Parent, or Child, or Adult? In all cases, we are - typically - looking at something in the past which has made an easy transition to a particular position untenable or frightening. There are people stuck in the child role for whom adulthood and parenthood present insuperable difficulties. Perhaps they are the offspring of a loving parent who couldn't tolerate their own nascent maturity: to be deemed worthy of love, they had to stay baby. Or else, alternatively one may feel one has to stay stuck in the child mode because a parent would be angry, castrating and humiliating if one dared to show independence and pride in one's adult ideals. At the other end of the spectrum, very poignantly, there are people whose younger selves were so badly treated, who experienced such anxiety and lack of support when they were children that the idea of being small even for a few hours presents unbearable challenges to their integrity. They may be very happy playing mummy and daddy; what they cannot ever do is be baby. The route out of all these impasses is, as always, self-exploration and mutual honesty in relationships. Problems are never as bad as they might be once we get them into consciousness and circulate them in discussion. To admit to being a child who doesn't dare to be an adult, or a parent who doesn't dare to be a child isn't just a peculiar-sounding confession. It suggests the presence of someone profoundly committed to eventual maturity and on their way to being the best kind of grown up."

    "Title": "Why Successful Love Requires Vulnerability",
    "Transcript": "We can state the matter starkly: we cannot be good lovers if we don't know how to be vulnerable. We make ourselves psychologically vulnerable whenever we let a partner know some of the ways in which we are weak, needy, scared, immature, incompetent or just plain odd - that is, some of the ways in which we are human. To be vulnerable is to dare to take off the usual cloak of normality and sensibleness with which we navigate the world and for once, to show someone who we really are, with all the fragility and unusualness implied. We might, as vulnerable people, admit to a desire to be mummied or daddied, to curl into a ball, to cry over a so-called small thing, to be reassured about an apparently minor flaw, to call up our lover every ten minutes, to suffer from anxiety or paranoia, to speak in a regressive voice or to hug a favourite stuffed animal. It's a hugely complicated step to confess - in front of someone we fundamentally want to impress and secure the affection of - that there are basic ways in which we fall short of what a proper adult is meant to be like. A certain kind of no-nonsense partner might well tell us sternly to grow up, complain about us to their friends and make hasty moves to end the relationship. As a result, we often lie, not for advantage or thievery, but in order to hold on to a love we desperately depend on. We pretend to be strong and unafraid. We put on a show of being someone else. Such acting works in many contexts. An uncomplaining, breezy competence and unemotive intelligence can make us an ideal employee, an admirable committee member and a thoroughly respectable citizen of the modern world. But in an intimate relationship, this form of caution is fatal. Our fears and inadequacies don't vanish because we have hidden them; we don't get any less child-like or odd because we have learnt to seem sensible. We simply end up living with someone who cannot know us - and who, because they are likely to take their lead from our own reserve, cannot show themselves to us in turn. We enclose ourselves in a prison of mutual deception. - The Heroism of Vulnerability To dare to be vulnerable involves a faith that, whatever we are inwardly most afraid and ashamed of in our own natures, must have counterparts in other people. We cannot be alone in our oddities. The only people we could assume are normal are those we don't yet know very well. But once we are past their flawless exteriors, every other person we meet - and especially the person we are now dating - will have their share of follies: they will suck their thumbs, be scared of ghosts, have psychological compulsions and worry about the size of their ears or the state of their friendships. We are guaranteed not to be alone in our strangeness and neediness. To be vulnerable is in essence to let a partner catch sight of a side of us that dates back to childhood: the distant time when we feared mummy would never come back, when we cried and no one comforted us, when daddy shouted at us and we were frozen with terror, when a rough friend told us we were a baby for still loving our stuffed elephant, when no one wanted to play with us in the school yard, when we tried and tried to explain and granny was still angry. To be properly, fully, vulnerable is to take the other into the frightened, small places of our past, and to let them see that we're still in significant ways the little, distressed person we once were. Honest, vibrant love is an encounter between two vulnerable children who otherwise do a very good job of masquerading as adults. - Why we flee from our own vulnerability What makes people reject the offer of vulnerability? The strength they display is an indicator of how punishing they have had to be towards their own fragile inner selves; it's a measure of how fast they had to grow up. If mummy dismissed their nighttime fears, they will have had to try to tell themselves - desperately - that mummy was right and that cry-babies really are disgusting. They perhaps deflected the rough boys' taunting of Minko (who granny knitted while they were still in the womb and whose trunk had half disintegrated under the intensity of their hugs) by throwing the little soft-toy in the bin. They managed their traumas by siding with those who hurt them. They focused on keeping their room tidy, passing exams and learning how to do business. And so they came to fear the very thing that they now most need: an enfolding, restorative and profoundly understanding tenderness towards their traumatised early selves. In a grim paradox, to have words of empathy whispered to them lovingly in the dark only reinforces their deepest fears; their protective shell snaps ever more tightly shut at the approach of sympathetic love; they respond to their own needs with panic and self-disgust. - Learning vulnerability We learn to be vulnerable by understanding that those who conveyed the imperative of a tougher (non-crying, non-fragile loving) self were profoundly incorrect and in their way, deeply traumatised themselves. Mummy was dismissive of our fears not because she was impressively astute in her theories of human development but because she was struggling with her own history of unattended need; the anti Minko 'friend' wasn't showing us the real path to being a grown up - they were inflicting on us some of the unkindness that was in other contexts directed towards them. We need to go back and convince ourselves - perhaps with a touch of anger - of how misguided our agents of 'growing up' really were. Finding a partner with whom we can be vulnerable constitutes a supreme act of restoration. After a lifetime of denial and false strength, we stand to find in another the sympathy that was sorely needed, but unavailable, to us in the past. The old wounds can be gently tended; we become stronger by learning to speak the language of weakness. By letting our hurt, babyish selves into the relationship, we open the way to a more nuanced, fruitful, creative and accurate idea of what it really means to be an adult."

    "Title": "3 Ways to Deal with Envious Friends...",
    "Transcript": "Almost inevitably, somewhere along the path of our friendships, we are fated to stumble upon one of the most paradoxical yet universal of characters: the envious friend. At one level, this person is kind, sympathises with us in our sorrows and believes that they want the best for us. Yet, despite such salutary affections, we may not be able to overlook some more troubling dynamics shimmering beneath the surface: - when we invite them for dinner, they repeatedly 'forget' to say thank you. - when we have a new partner, they don't appear overly pleased - when we get a new job, they don't ask us a single question about how its going. The situation is as wounding as it is uncharted. How are we to cope? Can this be happening to us? A few ways forward suggest themselves. 1. Acceptance of the Problem Firstly, we shouldn't ever compound the matter by denying that it might exist or wonder for too long whether we're imagining things. We're not. Those silences, missing questions and strange looks mean exactly what we suspect they do. Of course there is envy! We shouldn't expect any bond to be without at least an important degree of this ubiquitous feeling. And the reasons are self-evident. We tend to be friends with people who share our aspirations and values and it is therefore highly likely that at some point along our journey together, either they will acquire something we very much want, or vice versa: it might be a partner, a profession, a qualification or a home. But it will be something for sure. We envy people for the same reason as we are friends with them: because we like the same sort of things. We are unhelpfully inclined to be sentimental and therefore dishonest on this score: we deny that we could possibly harbour envy for someone we also like, which can lead us to unconvincing denials and cuts off opportunities for processing and growth. We need to learn to feel better about envy, in order not to have to twist our characters to avoid admitting to it. We should, with reasonable good cheer, simply own up to our envy as we would to a sore knee or an ulcer. Children can be good guides in this area: an average four year old is comedically open about their ravenous jealousy. They don't contort themselves into knots in the name of politeness. They wail immediately when their friend gets a better fire truck - or try to hit them over the head or gouge out their eyes. Parents tend to be so shocked by this, they force the child into fruitless denials. They inspire them to hide their envy from two people: the person they're envious of. And, far worse, themselves. They implicitly teach their offspring a pernicious and untrue idea: that you cannot both be a nice person and envy your friend. And therefore, tragically, in adult friendships, neither party is left able to call out the problem sensibly or deal with it maturely, leaving it to fester in embarrassment and shame instead. 2. Mutual Confession This brings us to the second solution to envy in friendships: we should go in for mutual playful non-pejorative moments of confession. All good friends should - in an entirely good natured way - routinely discuss the presence of envy between them. The question shouldn't be whether or not there is envy, just what sort of envy it might be this week. Friends should, for example, over dinner each write on a sheet of paper: What I am envious of now… And laugh with great compassion at the results. 3. Reassurance An important part of the reason why we don't process envy as we might is that we imagine there to be only one solution to the emotion: that the person who has something that their friend lacks will have to hand to it over. But of course, we can't be expected to surrender our partner, our house or our position nearer the top of the company to make our old friend feel better. However, that's not remotely necessary because what the person who envies us really wants is not, in the end, our love life or accommodation or profession. What they want is reassurance. They want to know that we still love them despite our new advantages. They crave to be told that though we have won the lottery, sold our shares or found a dazzling lover, we remain deeply attached to them and care for them as much as we ever did. Unfortunately, owning up to our true longing (and hearing it appeased) is devilishly hard for a sequence of reasons we're now in a position to appreciate: because the envious person can't admit to what they're feeling, because there aren't generally any good occasions on which confessions can be made - and because we aren't collectively schooled in the art of offering reassurance to others in the wake of our successes. In a better world, we would take greater care. As a matter of course, every time something went well for us, we would be sure to add in ample reassurance that - despite our new status - we would continue to love and cherish those we had long loved. We should stop worrying that there might be seams of envy entangled in our friendships; and we should focus instead on a far more important goal: learning to handle envy with kindness, honesty, intelligence and a fair bit of laughter too."

    "Title": "Van Gogh As a Guide to Confidence",
    "Transcript": "In mid-September 1888, a penniless Dutchman, who would in a few months be committed to an asylum and be dead within two years, sat down in the eastern corner of the Place du Forum in Arles and set to work on one of the most astonishing and beloved paintings ever made. 'Café Terrace at Night' juxtaposes our snug night time rituals under our defiant man-made lamps with the ultimate mysteries and sublimity of the cosmos. And yet, as we know, Van Gogh found no buyers for his masterpiece; no museum came begging, no gallery gave a damn. His work appeared wholly worthless to his entire era. He could barely afford lunch or a new pair of shoes. The local children mocked him. Rarely has a more despised or marginal figure walked the earth. The story is so familiar that we are apt to lose sight of its ongoing relevance and universal import: people miss things. On a very large scale. They did so then - and, by implication, they must continue to do so now. The reasons are not very complicated and don't belong to any sort of conspiracy; essentially, humans are herd animals. They show immense loyalty to group-think and resolute opposition to independent analysis. They follow what is fashionable. They are appalled where they are told to be appalled - and admiring where they are told to admire. They will bow to Van Gogh when instructed to and stamp on Van Gogh when no one tells them not to. Without making any claims for our genius, we should take inspiration. If there are ways in which we are presently neglected and criticised, we should be wholly unsurprised and, more importantly, unfrightened. This is the way things have always, and will always, be. An alternative to hating and undermining ourselves is to be, at points, a lot more acerbic about the sort of people we live among - and a lot more confident in our own path."

    "Title": "Why You Need to Have a Proper Adolescence",
    "Transcript": "It's an enormous privilege to have an adolescence - and, to an extent rarely spoken about, not everyone gets the chance to have one. Adolescence isn't just a particular time of one's second decade, and it won't unfold automatically simply when one reaches fourteen or seventeen and three quarters. Adolescence properly understood is a state in which we're able to explore - with courage and newfound independence - who we might be outside of the projections and mental dictates placed upon us with enormous ingenuity and great force by our parents. Parents are the greatest propagandists that any of us will ever meet with - and part of their genius is that we rarely know what they are up to. Below the surface they are engaged in a ruthless and ongoing attempt to sell us a version of reality: to tell us what we are 'really' like, what we actually need, what life is truly about - and who they have been and what their motives are. It goes without saying that some of their ideas will be eminently correct but the function of adolescence is to take a good long look at, and deal with, the ones that aren't. Adolescence is an initially inarticulate and then gradually more discerning protest against everything that has come to feel false, ill-fitting and superfluously applied to our identities since we were born. We may realise, as we progress through adolescence, that we really aren't interested in particular sides of the workplace that our parents have held in high esteem, that we don't care about a given approach to morality or vision of politeness and goodness and that we would prefer to join the circus - or Goldman Sachs. Good parents are secure enough not to mind, they can accept that their child may have turned into that always rather remarkable thing: a separate person. They can even take it if their children are furious for a while, try to kill them in their imaginations and see all their incompetence and stupidity without a filter of sentimentality or fear: what clever people they are to be able to perceive things so distinctly! What a tribute to one's parenting to allow such loathing to play out! The difficulty lies with the parents who brook no such opposition; who are too vengeful, depressed or anxious to tolerate dissent and force us to disown bits of ourselves in order to retain their love. The good news is that it's never too late for an adolescence. We can start to have one as soon as we realise our right to define ourselves away from parental laws. We can even do it in secret. Without spots to give things away, no one will have to know the critical task that is at play beneath our sober middle-aged facades: a belated search for our true selves."

    "Title": "How to Get Less Defensive in Relationships",
    "Transcript": "If we had to make one generalisation about why relationships fail, it would be this: because of defensiveness. Defensiveness is behind a predominant share of the failure of all relationships. The difficulty is that there is no way of escaping the sort of situations that can trigger defensiveness. However sweet and fascinating two people might initially be, it is inescapable that they will also with time, and the birth of true intimacy, stumble upon aspects of one another's characters that cannot help but generate difficulties and a degree of dismay. Each partner could be determined to be only kind, but the way that they shell an egg, leave the bathroom, deal with their suitcase on returning from a trip, handle the household keys or tell an anecdote will gradually unleash powerful degrees of frustration or puzzlement in those who have to share their lives. The problem starts when we, as partners, venture to air our responses. They might get angry or they might get sad but the underlying message is the same: being found in some way imperfect is entirely unacceptable and deeply contrary to the spirit of true love. 'Love me for who I am' is the fateful rallying cry of all lovers headed for disaster; it is in reality a monstrously unfair demand to be loved just as we are, given our panoply of faults, compulsions and immaturities. With a modicum of self-awareness and honesty, we should only ever expect to be loved for who we hope to be, for who we are at our best moments, for the good that is in us in a latent and yet not-realised state. The spirit of true love should require that whenever there is feedback, we turn gratefully to our partner and ask for more, that we continuously search to access a better version of ourselves, that we see love as a classroom in which our lover can teach us one or two things about who we should become - rather than a burrow in which our existing errors can be endorsed and ratified. A less-defended attitude isn't a random gift; We begin to become less defensive when we take on board some of the following: We can dare to admit our fear: Behind defensiveness, there is always a dread of being humiliated and abandoned. But a decent partner, if we let them know what we're afraid of, will be moved by our tender desperation and hasty fear. And they should help us to see that what there is really to be afraid of now is not criticism, but an inability to accept its gentle manifestations with grace. Criticism is normal If love really required an absence of even the most minor flaws, no one could possibly qualify for a relationship. Yet in reality, we are love-worthy not because we are ever perfect, but because none of us ever can be. Love isn't fragile: In the defensive person's mind, the smallest comment is like the small rockfall that announces an avalanche. There seems no way to trust that it really is just about how long pasta should be cooked, or the right way to make a bed; the underlying intention seems always to be to inflict a devastating wound and speed the entire relationship to a close. The defensive person has not had a chance to experience the robustness of love; how it is wholly possible to call someone the worst names in the lexicon and then, ten minutes later, to want to lie softly in their arms, tenderness having been renewed and reinvigorated by an opportunity to purge a given frustration. There can be ruptures - and repair. True love is resilient; it's not destroyed by a detail but only ever by the way that a detail can't be acknowledged and processed. Defensiveness can be outgrown. When searching for a partner, we need to look out for someone who can join us in the heroic quest to recognise and overcome defensiveness. We might even raise this ambition on an early date ('I'd like one day to move to the country, learn Spanish and, with a lover's help, get over my defensiveness…' we might declare by way of introduction to our goals). We could frame the attempt to listen to criticism without fury or hurt as belonging to one of life's mightiest challenges - alongside sporting achievement or business success. Eventually, with a lot of effort, we could hope to reach a stage when a partner could point out with tact and humanity that we have bad breath or that our shoes don't match our top and, rather than reacting as we have grown up to do, we could simply turn to them, smile benignly and say what flawed humans should always respond with when another member of the species deigns to help them to grow into a better version of themselves: thank you."

    "Title": "LITERATURE - Edward Gibbon",
    "Transcript": "The news is often determined to tell us that we live in uniquely critical times, beset by political disasters and afflicted by terrible crises and that the demise of human civilisation is surely imminent. We are encouraged to view the world - and our own lives - in bleak, apocalyptic terms. Oddly, history can be powerfully consoling, not because it tells us that our times are great, but because it shows us how normal large societal troubles really are. The English 18th century historian Edward Gibbon is particularly helpful with this task of bringing us to a less frightened perspective. His massive, elegantly written work covers 1500 years, from the pinnacle of Roman power around the year 180 AD, through the collapse of the Western Empire to the final fall of its last outpost, the city of Constantinople, in 1453. Gibbon started work on the series of volumes around 1770 and completed the final volume on a summer's evening in 1787 while he was on holiday in Switzerland. The immense story he tells moves from one disaster to another, century after century. There are mad, despotic Emperors, the barbarians invade again and again, the plans for reform fail, the key institutions become corrupt, the government loses control of the army, there are plagues that last for decades, the harvests decline, there is insane factionalism, the economy collapses, the Roman Forum - once the heart of the Empire - ia abandoned and sheep graze amongst the ruins. Only Constantinople holds out, getting weaker and weaker. The vastly prolonged decline ends with the fall of the city - where the people still called themselves Romans - to Muhammed the Second in the middle of the 15th Century. And yet the world didn't end. The main beneficiaries of the demise of the last fragment of the Empire was the city state of Venice, which became the most widely loved place on earth; and the exodus of scholars to the West was pivotal in the story of the Renaissance. And all the time - in the centuries of decline - new forces had been developing in the background. The wild people of the North who the Romans so feared became, eventually, Danish interior designers and German intellectuals and Parisian socialites. The Picts and Scots who were seen as the least civilised people on earth would, one day, renew their capital city, Edinburgh, as an architectural homage to Roman culture. The disasters are always happening on the surface: they are what we hear about. The gradual process of renewal and elevation escapes our notice at the time. It's nice to read Gibbon late at night, at the end of a day when the news seems unbearably grim, and to skim through his placid account of yet another moment of apparent catastrophe and think of him sitting learnedly in his study reflecting on disaster and yet being himself the obvious heir - with his classical prose, his quiet dignity and his sense of balance - of the very empire he though he was lamenting."

    "Title": "Why Parents Bully Their Children",
    "Transcript": "One of the strangest and saddest phenomena of psychological life is that there are parents, too many parents, who end up - while sometimes only half realising it - bullying their own children. The bullying may take many forms. Why do parents bully their children? In short, in order to try to feel better about themselves. Because they suffer intensely in the very same area that they are bullying their child in. If we, as children, want to know what our parents were afraid of or haunted by, we only need to ask: in what areas did they bully me? What did they make me feel scared or inadequate about? Someone made them feel awful and they surmise - by twisted logic - that they will feel better through the process of making their own child feel very bad indeed; they aren't doing it personally, the child is collateral damage to a misguided project of healing and attenuation of symptoms. It doesn't make any sense of course, but it may actually work for the parent, for a time. Let's imagine a parent who harbours a terrible fear of being stupid; somewhere in their own past, they were belittled and made to feel hugely inadequate. Now a child comes along, their own child, full of the normal hesitations and weaknesses of early infancy. Without really realising what they are up to, the parent grows inflamed and incensed by this child's apparent stupidity - and starts to mock and attack in another what they fear and hate in themselves. It makes them feel a bit better. The child becomes a repository of all that they fail to tolerate in themselves. They, the child, are the dumb one, so they, the parent, don't have to be; they, the child, are the stupid and ugly one, so they, the parent, don't have to be. The child is a cry baby, a weakling and a pathetic twig. And therefore the parent is liberated to live more easily within itself. The bad is contained and localised; it can't be in them, if it is all in little him or her. 'Don't be such a moron or a ninny. Stop being such a wimp,' the parent screams at the child, in the hope that no idiocy or weakness remains in them. It can take bullied children a very long time to realise they have been bullied. They don't, after all, grow up thinking that someone else has actually made them feel stupid or made them feel ugly or made them feel soiled - let alone their own parent, whom they depend on and admire and long to be loved by. They simply think they are stupid, ugly and soiled. There is no call for an explanation or a cause. Yet if we are those now grown up bullied children, we don't need to wonder too much more about what might have happened to us. We simply need to take stock of how we feel about ourselves and guess that the terrible judgements and sensations that we have about ourselves did not arise spontaneously. They are the outcome of events - physical behaviours as well as words and atmospheres that we were subjected to. The feelings we harbour of ourselves are legacies of real occurrences in the world. Someone, who isn't necessarily owning up to it, made us feel a certain way - and that is why we are now in such pain. Typically, those who have been bullied don't look backwards. Their illnesses point them relentlessly to the present and the future. The bullied anticipate terrible things happening to them that echo events that once happened to them but they don't remember these in any way. They are cause-less paranoiacs, self-haters and worriers. Catastrophe is never far away. A person feels they are ugly because two decades ago, a mother made them feel as much. A person feels they have done something very wrong because, even further back, someone did something very wrong to them. The fear contains the imprint of unconscious history. We overcome our bullying when we learn to discriminate: between what actually belongs to us and what was placed in us, between who we are and what we've been told we are, between how our caregivers like to present themselves and what they have actually done. Our triggers and apprehensions lie along the faultlines of our early traumas; they can guide us back to what we were suffered through when we are ready to explore. It's sad enough that children are bullied by their parents; it's even sadder that a legacy of this is that children can't realise what happened to them. And instead typically fall victim to the same tricks played out by substitute figures in their later lives: partners, colleagues, even the media. We're on our way to overcoming bullying when we can say, at last, I am not ugly, I was made to feel unacceptable. I haven't done anything wrong, something wrong was done to me. And in general: I am not awful - something awful happened to me."

    "Title": "The Importance of Being Single",
    "Transcript": "One of the most important preconditions of a good relationship is a satisfactory perspective on being single. The more we are happy to be on our own, the more we will be able to exercise the correct degree of caution around finding a new companion. The bedrock of true love is happy singledom. Unfortunately, our societies do very little to help us to be calm or at ease in our own company. Singledom is framed as an involuntary, depressing and always hopefully temporary state. The notion that someone might want or need to be on their own, perhaps for a long while, terrifies a world shaped by legions of silently miserable couples who need confirmation that they have not chosen the wrong path. To enforce the idea of what single people are missing, advertisers can never have enough of showing off tantalising images of happy couples walking hand in hand on beaches - and most entertainment venues, holiday destinations and social occasions feel compelled to patronise, overcharge and otherwise demean anyone who has had the impudence to venture out on their own. Unfortunately, being miserable while single fatally undermines our judgement about who we might get together with. When someone is starving, they will eat anything (Dostoevsky wrote a harrowing short story about a famished child who eats a candle made of pig fat); and we're equally liable, in emotional desperation, to run into the nearest nightclub to secure a chump we'll be appalled to find beside us at day break. We eventually learn: being in an unsatisfactory relationship is clearly worse, that is, even more lonely, than being alone. The central challenge of being alone is coping with the fear of what singlehood means: being alone is bearable in relation to how 'normal' (that highly nebulous yet highly influential concept) the condition feels to us at any given point; it can either be a break from an honourably busy life, or sure evidence that we are an unwanted, wretched, disgusting and emotionally diseased being. This is tricky but ultimately very hopeful, for it suggests that if only we could work on what being alone means to us, we could theoretically endure long periods alone. To build ourselves a new mental model of what being alone should truly mean, we might rehearse a few of the following arguments. Despite what an unfriendly voice inside our heads might tell us, we are the ones who can chose whether or not to be alone. Our solitude is willed rather than imposed. No one ever needs to be alone so long as they don't mind who they are with. But we do mind: the wrong kind of company is a great deal lonelier for us than being by ourselves, that is, it's further from what matters to us, more grating in its insincerity and more of a reminder of disconnection and misunderstanding than is the conversation we can have in the quiet of our own minds. Being alone is not proof that we have been rejected by the world; it's a sign that we've taken a good look at the available options and have - with wisdom - done some rejecting ourselves. Another big thought is that we need to appreciate how long it will take to find someone, given how choosy we are (for very good reasons). We aren't just looking for anyone. The right candidate will be no less easy to find than a great job or a beautiful house. It might take many months, probably years. Expectations matter. If we regard a decade as a plausible time frame, then six months will skip by. Theres is no better guarantee of a successful relationship than knowing that we could, and can, manage perfectly well on our own. It means that we will only look for someone who can deeply contribute to our life, not someone who can do the laundry with us or keep us company on Sunday evenings. This gives us the strength to back out of unsatisfactory unions as quickly as we should. Being in a couple can't and shouldn't mean that we are utterly reliant on the other for our self-esteem, our daily self-management or for the meeting of our domestic needs. When we have under our belt a significant experience of thriving on our own, we will be able to cope with the inevitable points at which even a very nice partner can't sustain us; we'll be less demanding; more competent and more forensic in what we seek from a lover. It turns out that our willingness to stay on our own is what centrally predicts how likely we'll be to find and bring to fruition a relationship with someone else. Being at ease with being single is the needed, secure platform from which to make a sane and wise choice about who to create a joint life with."

    "Title": "ART/ARCHITECTURE - Mark Rothko",
    "Transcript": "The most unexpectedly uplifting and consoling artist of the 20th century was the abstract painter Mark Rothko, the high priest of grief and loss who spent the latter part of his career turning out a succession of sublime and sombre canvases that spoke, as he put it, of the 'tragedy of being human'. Born in Dvinsk, Russia, Rothko emigrated to the United States at the age of ten and immediately grew to despise the aggressive good cheer and steely optimism of his adopted land. Appalled by the sentimentality around him, he learnt to make art that was insular, unrelenting, sombre and oriented towards pain. Rothko's favourite colours were a burnt burgundy, dark grey, pitch black and blood red, occasionally, alleviated by a sliver of yellow. In 1958, Rothko was offered a large sum to paint some murals for a soon to be opened opulent New York restaurant, the Four Seasons on Park Avenue. It was, as he put it, 'a place where the richest bastards of New York will come to feed and show off.' His intentions for them soon became clear: 'I hope to ruin the appetite of every son of a bitch who ever eats in that room,' and to that end, he set to work on some large black and maroon colour fields expressing a mood of terror and archaic anguish. However, shortly before the paintings were due to go on display, Rothko called up his patrons, explained his feelings - and sent back the money. He then gave his paintings to London's Tate Gallery, where they were hung in a quiet airy contemplative, religious-seeming space, that enclosed the viewer in an atmosphere of meditative mortification. The paintings remain ideal companions for visitors who drift into the gallery at their wits' end, who might be working through the loss of a partner or the ruin of their career - and who need more than anything else to know that they are not alone. Rothko's canvases - though focused on the darkness - are never themselves depressing to look at because they lend our difficulties dignity and legitimacy. To bathe in their atmosphere is to gain a distinct sense of comfort, like lying in a tender person's arms who says little other than a modest 'I know' in response to our dejection and loss. With Rothko as our guide, our pain and sorrow matters a little less. .We can start to rediscover a taste for life when we see that we're not alone in finding it hard; that it is acceptable, even necessary, sometimes to hate the smiling 'bastards' who so annoyed Rothko. We can build friendships - imaginative or real - around shared honesty about dark things. Unhappiness is just - as wise artists have always liked to remind us, and despite the suggestions of all those confident-seeming people congratulating themselves in the world's fancy restaurants - very normal indeed."

    "Title": "Why We Always Feel Bad and Guilty",
    "Transcript": "There's a strange law of psychology that reveals that small children who are treated badly by their parents will always - rather strangely - blame themselves, and not their parents, for their injuries. They hate who they are rather than hating those who have done them wrong. Small children immediately notice when they are not loved as much as they might and need to be. They understand nothing of the reasons for the hard-heartedness but feel all of the pain. And yet they need to locate some form of explanation nevertheless and quickly and intuitively settle on the one that always feels most compelling to them: that they have done something wrong. Why is mummy so agitated? Because they have done something wrong. Why is daddy so cold? Because they have done something wrong. Why aren't they being treated kindly? Because they have done something wrong. Why is their little sister being preferred to them? Because they've done something wrong. After a little while of this, their whole character becomes oriented towards guilt: they are - in numberless ways - simply and primordially 'bad'. In adult life, it then takes very little to reignite a feeling that somewhere along the line, they have said and done something awful. What precise offence they believe themselves to have committed shifts according to events in their lives and the prevailing public mood: in a religious age, they may feel they have done something wrong in the eyes of god. In an age obsessed with paedophilia, they will fear they have done harm to a child. When racism is being highlighted as a leading public sin, they will be tortured that they harbour racist feelings. Closer to home, they will fear that they have upset their partner, hurt their friends or offended an employee. Whenever they make a new friend, they know that soon enough, the friend will realise they are 'bad' and let them go. What makes the guilt so hard to shake off is that they cannot exactly pinpoint its origin. A diffuse mood hangs over them whose title is simply: 'I have done something wrong…' The mood is particularly prone to descend when they are lonely; guilt thrives on isolation (just as it is love that may disperse it). When the mood reaches a pitch, the sufferer may fantasise about going to a police station and handing themselves in. There could be such relief in finally being able to tell the officials: I am awful, I am guilty, I have done so many wrong things… One could be put into handcuffs and led to the cells and there, finally, gain some relief from the awful tension. Needless to say, there will be no such benefit in reality; the only way to cure the guilt is to unpick its origins, that is, to realise that we are not bad at all, rather that we have been bullied without justice into thinking we might be so. We need - at last - to exchange self-flagellation for a little bit of righteous anger against those who have done us wrong."

    "Title": "LITERATURE - C. P. Cavafy",
    "Transcript": "We spend much of our lives trying to fulfill our distant ambitions: wanting to create the circumstances in which, finally, we'll be happy. We'll have worked everything out, organised our way of life and finally, we'll be happy. It's an enchanting idea but, ironically, it means that most of the time we're restless because we're not there yet. The present is just the tedious, dreary period we have to get through until, in the future, we can relax and enjoy ourselves. The unexpected companion we perhaps need to ease our frustration is a bespectacled, Greek-speaking, middle-ranking civil servant: Constantine Cavafy - who was born in Alexandria in 1863. He often felt displaced; he lived almost all his life in Egypt but thought of himself as a citizen of Byzantium - once the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. Cavafy only hit creative side in his forties and published little during his lifetime - held back by anxiety that that the overtly homoerotic themes he often wanted to explore would be met only with condemnation. The poem that has most to help us, usually contained in a book of his Collected Poems, is one entitled Ithaca. Technically, the island of Ithaca was the home of the legendary Greek hero Ulysses - to which he spent ten adventurous years returning after the fall of Troy. But here it signals whatever we imagine our destination in life to be. It's the image we have in our heads of the distant time when we'll be able to live properly - once we've found a partner or bought a house or have secured a divorce or made a fortune or retired. Cavafy doesn't want to help us get there more quickly; instead he wants to delay arrival as long as possible. As you set out for Ithaka hope your road is a long one Then he invokes what he calls 'harbours' May there be many summer mornings when, with what pleasure, what joy, you enter harbors you're seeing for the first time; These, emphatically, are not our destination: they are the places and things, people and experiences we encounter precisely because we're not home yet and which won't any longer be available to us when we finally get there. His ideal is that when we arrive at our home we'll find that it is 'poor': it has little to offer us. Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey. Without her you wouldn't have set out. She has nothing left to give you now. And if you find her poor, Ithaka won't have fooled you. Wise as you will have become. If we live this way - with a warm sense of appreciation, with a sense of adventure, with a willingness to explore byways - our destination, when we get there, won't be the big fulfillment we once expected it to be. We'll have found our fulfillment along the way. It won't be what we find at the end that pleases us, so much as what we bring with us. It won't be marriage, making money or retiring that in itself is so great; what will matter is what we have discovered in ourselves before we reached these destinations."

    "Title": "What Is Your Partner Really Thinking?",
    "Transcript": "Of course, we don't officially have the slightest belief in mind reading: we scoff at the absurd idea that we might telepathically know what number between one and a million a stranger is thinking of or that we could place our hands on someone else's skull and thereby intuit the precise details of what they dreamt of last night. But in relationships, whatever our professed scepticism, we very frequently proceed as if mind reading were not only possible but a standard requirement and possibility in love, something of whose absence we would have every right to complain with bitterness and surprise. In a great many ways, we simply assume that our partner must automatically be able to know the movements and preoccupations of our minds. And our expectations shows up in one of the standard ways in which we speak of the perfection of a lover in the initial days of rapture: they seem to know what we are thinking, without us needing to speak… But our superstitious commitment to mind-reading soon evolves into something darker as relationships proceed, for example when: - we get huffy that our partner didn't realise that our off-colour comment was only a joke - we can't imagine they could even think we'd like the bizarre birthday present they bought us - we're offended that they like a book we've already decided is silly - we're annoyed that they didn't know we wouldn't want to go to the mountains this summer - they can't understood the mood we are in when we get back from having lunch with our mother We get worked up because we can't conceive that certain ideas and feelings that are so vivid in our minds should not immediately be obvious to someone who professes to care for us. We quickly fall into believing that the partner's incomprehension can only be explained in one way: it must come down to wilfulness or nastiness. And therefore, it seems only fair that we respond with one of our standard forms of punishment due to all those who should have known better: a sulk - that paradoxical pattern of behaviour in which we refuse, for several hours or even a day or two, to reveal what is wrong to our confused partner because they should just know. The origins of our reckless hopes are, in a sense, extremely touching. When we were little a parent really did, at key moments, seem to know what we were thinking without us needing to speak. As if by magic, they guessed that we might want some milk. With a medium's genius, they determined that we needed a bath or a nap or that a blanket was a bit scratchy for our cheek. And from this, an equation formed in our minds: whenever I am properly loved, I do not need to explain. But however great our parents were at reading our minds, they had a huge advantage over our partners: we were - back then - really very simple. Our requirements were usefully few: we needed only to be fed, bathed, slept, taken to the potty and entertained with a picture book or bit of string. But we had no advanced views on politics, we had no complicated opinions on interior design, our psyches didn't register feint tremors of sarcasm or hypocrisy, we couldn't be thrown off course by the pronunciation of a word. How much more complicated we have grown since then. We are now adults who can feel very strongly that a table must be placed symmetrically in a room twenty centimetres from the door to the kitchen; or we like it very much when or partner rolls up their sleeves but we hate them wearing a short-sleeved shirt, especially the green one; we like being teased (but only sometimes and never about our age); we are very critical of our mother but can't allow anyone to mention her habit of being late; we come across as confident but think of ourselves as shy; we like art but have an aversion to museums; we love stone fruits but hate peaches; we talk a lot about politics but can't stand reading newspapers. Our partner's inability to know all this - fast and decisively - necessarily feels like an intimate insult and the complex task of explaining our thoughts and attitudes like an unreasonable imposition. But once we accept that there is no such thing as mindreading, a central part of our relationship becomes the slow, careful process of piecing together - in one another's company - what matters to us and why, with all the surprise and moments of genuine revelation this entails. We accept that there will be an immense amount we need to teach each other about who we are pretty much every day - while trusting that this is not an attack on the idea of love."

thought that it was time to try to sleep would wake me I wanted to put down the book I thought I still had in my hands and blow out my light I hadn't ceased while sleeping to form Reflections on what I just read but these Reflections are taken a rather peculiar turn it seemed to me that I myself was what the book was talking about and Church quartet the Rivalry between frostwa the first and Charles V this belief lived on for a few seconds after my waking shock my reason but lay heavy like scales on my eyes and kept them from realizing that the Candlestick was no longer lit then it began to grow unintelligible to me as after metam psychosis do the thoughts of an earlier existence the subject of the book detached itself from me I was free to apply myself to it or not immediately I recovered my sight and I was amazed to find a Darkness all around me soft and restful for my eyes perhaps even more so for my mind to which it appeared a thing without cause incomprehensible a thing truly dark I would ask myself what time it might be I could hear the whistling of the trains which remote or nearby like the singing of a bird in a forest plotting the distances described to me the extent of the deserted Countryside where the traveler hastens towards the nearest station and the Little Road he is following will be engraved on his memory by the excitement he owes to new places to unaccustomed activities to the recent conversation and the farewells under the unfamiliar lamp that follow him still through the Silence of the night the imminent sweetness of his return I would rest my cheeks tenderly against the lovely cheeks of the pillow which Full and fresh are like the cheeks of our childhood I would strike a match to look at my watch nearly midnight this is the hour when the sick man who's been obliged to go off on a journey and has had to sleep in an unfamiliar Hotel awakened by an attack is cheered to see a ray of light under the door how fortunate it's already morning in a moment the servants will be up he will be able to ring someone will come to help him the hope of being relieved gives him the courage to suffer in fact he thought he heard footsteps the steps approach then recede and the ray of light that was under his door has disappeared it's midnight they've just turned off the gas the last servant has gone and he will have to suffer the whole night through without remedy I would go back to sleep and sometimes afterwards woke only briefly for a moment long enough to hear the organic Creek of the woodwork opened my eyes and stare at the Kaleidoscope of the darkness Savor in a momentary glimmer of Consciousness the Sleep into which were plunged the furniture the room that whole of which I was only a small part and whose insensibility I would soon return to share or else while sleeping I had effortlessly returned to a forever vanished period of my early life rediscovered one of my childish Terrors such as that my great uncle would pull me by my curls a terror dispelled on the day the dawn for me of a new era when they were cut off I'd forgotten that event during my sleep I recovered its memory as soon as I managed to wake myself up to escape the hands of my great uncle but as a precautionary measure I would completely surround my head with my pillow for returning to the world of Dreams sometimes as Eve was born from one of Adam's Ribs a woman was born during my sleep from a cramped position of my thigh formed of the pleasure I was on the point of enjoying she I imagined was the one offering it to me my body which felt in hers my own warmth tried to return to itself inside her I woke up the rest of humanity seemed very remote compared with this woman I'd left scarcely a few moments before my cheek was still warm from her kiss my body aching from the weight of hers if sometimes happened she had the features of a woman I had known in life I would devote myself entirely to this end to finding her again like those who go off on a journey to see a longed full City with their own eyes and imagine that one can enjoy in reality the charm of a dream little by little the memory of her would fade I'd forgotten the girl of my dream a sleeping man holds in a circle around him the sequence of the hours the order of the years and worlds he consults them instinctively as he wakes and reads in them in a second the point on the earth he occupies the time that has elapsed up to his waking but their ranks can be mixed up broken if towards morning after a bout of insomnia sleep overcomes him as he is Reading in a position too different from the one in which he usually sleeps his raised arm alone is enough to stop the Sun and make it Retreat and in the first minute of his waking he will no longer know what time it is he will think he is only just gone to bed if he dozes off in a position still more displaced and Divergent for instance after dinner sitting in an armchair then the confusion among the disordered worlds will be complete the magic armchair will send him traveling at top speed through time and space and at the moment of opening his eyelids he will believe he went to bed several months earlier in another country but it was enough if in my own bed my sleep was deep and allowed my mind to relax entirely then it would let go of the map of the place where I had fallen asleep and when I woke in the middle of the night since I didn't know where I was I didn't even understand in the first moment who I was all I had in its original Simplicity was the sense of existence as it may quiver in the depths of an animal I was more bereft than a caveman but then the memory not yet of the place where I was but of several of those where I had lived and where I might have been would come to me like help from on high to pull me out of the Void from which I couldn't have got out on my own I passed over centuries of civilization in one second the image confusedly glimpsed of oil lamps then of wing collar shirts gradually recomposed myself's original features perhaps the immobility of the things around us is imposed on them by our certainty that they are themselves and not others by the immobility of our minds confronting them however that may be when I woke thus my mind restlessly attempting without success to discover where I was everything revolved around me in the darkness things countries years my body too but numbed to move would try to locate according to the form of its fatigue the position of its limbs in order to deduce from this the direction of the wall the location of the furniture in order to reconstruct and name the dwelling in which it found itself its memory the memory of Its Ribs its knees its shoulders offered in succession several of the rooms where it had slept well around it the invisible walls changing Place according to the shape of the imagined room spun through the shadows and even before my mind which hesitated on the thresholds of times and shapes had identified the house by reassembling the circumstances it my body would recall the kind of bed in each one the location of the doors the angle at which the light came in through the windows the existence of a hallway along with a thought I had had as I fell asleep and that I'd recovered upon waking my stiffened side trying to guess its orientation would imagine for instance that it lay facing the wall in a big canopied bed and immediately I would say to myself why I went to sleep in the end even though Mama didn't come to say goodnight to me I was in the country at the house of my grandfather dead for many years and my body the side on which I was resting faithful guardians of a past my mind ought never to have forgotten recall to me the flame of the NightLight of Bohemian glass in the shape of an urn hanging from the ceiling by little chains the mantelpiece of Sienna marble in my bedroom at compreh at my grandparents house in remote days which at this moment I imagined were present without picturing them to myself exactly and which I would see more clearly in a little while fully awake then the memory of a new position would be reborn the wall would slip away in another Direction I was in my room at Madame de saldos in the country but lord it's 10 o'clock or even later that I finished dinner I must have overslept in the nap I take every evening when I come back from my walk with Madame de salou before putting on my evening clothes for many years have passed since compreh where however late we returned it was the sunset's red Reflections I saw in the Pains of my window it's another sort of Life One leads at thomsonville at Madame de San Luis another sort of pleasure I take in going out only at night in following By Moonlight those Lanes where I used to play in the Sun and the room where I will have fallen asleep instead of dressing for dinner from far off I can see it as we come back pierced by the flares of the lamp lone beacon in the night these revolving confused evocations never lasted for more than a few seconds in my brief uncertainty about where I was I didn't distinguish the various suppositions of which it was composed any better than we isolate when we see a horse run the successive positions shown To Us by kinetoscope but I'd seen sometimes one sometimes another of the bedrooms I'd inhabited in my life and in the end I would recall them all in the long reveries that followed my waking winter bedrooms in which soon as you're in bed you bury your head in a nest that you weave the most disparate things a corner of the pillow the top of the covers a bit of shawl the side of the bed and an issue of the dubajors that you end up by cementing together using the birds technique of pressing down on it indefinitely where in icy weather the pleasure you enjoy is the feeling that you're separated from the outdoors like the sea swallow which makes its nest deep in an underground passage in the warmth of the Earth and where since the fire is kept burning all night in the fireplace you sleep in a great cloak of warm Smoky air pierced by the glimmers from the logs breaking into flame again a sort of immaterial Alcove a warm cave hollowed in the heart of the room itself a zone of heat with moving thermal Contours aerated by drafts that cool your face and come from the corners from the parts close to the window or far from The Hearth and that have grown cold again summer bedrooms where you love becoming one with a soft Knight where the Moonlight leaning against the half open shutters casts its Enchanted ladder to the foot of the bed where you sleep almost in the open air like a tit Mouse rocked by the breeze on the tip of a ray of light sometimes the Louis XVI bedroom so gay that even the first night I'd not been too unhappy there and where the Slender columns that lightly supported the ceiling stood aside with such Grace to show and reserve the place where the bed was sometimes on the other hand the small bedroom with a very high ceiling hollowed out in the form of a pyramid two stories high and partly paneled in Mahogany where from the first second I'd been mentally poisoned by the unfamiliar odor of the vetiver convinced of the hostility of the Violet curtains and the insolent indifference of the clock chattering loudly as though I were not there where strange and pitiless quadrangular Cheval glass barring obliquely one of the corners of the room carved from deep inside the soft fullness of my usual field of vision a sight for itself which I'd not expected where my mind struggling for hours to dislodge itself to stretch upwards so as to take the exact shape of the room and succeed in filling its gigantic funnel to the very top had suffered many hard nights while I lay at full length in my bed my eyes lifted my ear anxious my nostril restive my heart pounding until habit had changed the color of the curtains silenced the clock taught pity to the cruel oblique mirror concealed if not driven out completely the smell of the vetiver and appreciably diminished the apparent height of the ceiling habit that's skillful but very slow housekeeper who Begins by letting our minds suffer for weeks in a temporary Arrangement but whom we are nevertheless very happy to find for without habit and reduce to no more than its own resources our mind would be powerless to make a lodging habitable certainly I was now Wide Awake My Body had veered around one last time and the good angel of certainty had brought everything around me to a standstill had laid me down under my covers in my bedroom and had put approximately where they belonged in the darkness my chest of drawers my death my fireplace the window on the street and the two doors even though I knew I was not in any of the houses of which the ignorance of the waking moment had instantly if not presented me with a distinct picture at least made me believe the presence possible my memory had been stirred generally I wouldn't try to go back to sleep right away I'd spent the greater part of the night remembering our life in the old days in compreh at my great aunt's house in balbec in Paris in dossier in Venice elsewhere still remembering the places the people I'd known there what I'd seen of them what I'd been told about them every day beginning in the late afternoon long before the moment when I'd have to go to bed and stay there without sleeping far away from my mother and grandmother my bedroom again became the fixed and painful locus of my preoccupations they had indeed hit upon the idea to distract me on the evenings when they found me looking too unhappy of giving me a magic lantern which while awaiting the dinner hour they would set on top of my lamp after the fashion of the first Architects and master glaciers of the gothic age it replaced the opacity of the walls with impalpable iridescences Supernatural multi-colored apparitions where Legends were depicted as in a wavering momentary stained glass window sadness was only increased by this because the mere change in lighting destroyed the familiarity my bedroom had acquired for me which except for the torment of going to bed had made it tolerable for me now I no longer recognized it and I was uneasy there as in a room in some hostel or Chalet to which I'd come for the first time straight from the railway train moving at the jerky pace of his horse gollo filled with a hideous design came out of the small triangular Forest that velveted the hillside with dark green an advanced jolting towards the castle of porge and viefta Bravo this Castle was cut off along a curved line that was in fact the edge of one of the glass ovals arranged in the frame that you slipped between the grooves of the lantern it was only a section of Castle and it had a moor in front of it where Jean viev stood dreaming wearing a blue belt the the castle and the Moor were yellow and I hadn't had to wait to see them to find out their color since before the glasses of the frame did so the bronze sonority of the name Brabo had shown it to me clearly gollo stopped for a moment to listen sadly to the patter read out loud by my great aunt which he seemed to understand perfectly conforming his posture with a meekness that didn't exclude a certain Majesty that the directions of the text then he moved off at the same jerky pace and nothing could stop his Slow Ride if the lantern was moved I couldn't make out gollo's horse continuing to advance over the window curtains swelling out with their folds descending into their fist shoots the body of gollo himself in its Essence is Supernatural as that of his mount accommodated every material obstacle every Henderson object that he encountered by taking it as his skeleton and absorbing it into himself even the doorknob he immediately adapted to and floated invincibly over with his red robe or his pale face as Noble and as Melancholy as ever but revealing no disturbance at this transvertebration certainly I found some charm in these brilliant projections which seemed to emanate from a Merovingian past and send out around me such ancient reflections of History I cannot express the uneasiness caused in Me by this intrusion of mystery and Beauty into a room I had at last filled with myself to the point of paying no more attention to the room than to that self the anesthetizing influence of habit having ceased I would begin to have thoughts and feelings and they are such sad things that doorknob of my room which differed for me from all the other doorknobs in the world and that it seemed to open of its own accord without my having to turn it so unconscious had its handling become for me was now serving as an astral body for gollo and as soon as they rang for dinner I hastened to run to the dining room with a big hanging lamp ignorant of gollo and Bluebeard and well acquainted with my family and beef shed the same light as on every other evening and to fall into the arms of Mama's misfortunes made all the dearer to me while gollo's crimes drove me to examine my own conscience more scrupulously after dinner alas I soon had to leave mama who stayed talking with the others in the garden if the weather was fine in the little drawing room to which everyone withdrew if the weather was bad everyone except my grandmother who felt that it's a Pity to shut oneself off indoors in the country and who had endless arguments with my father on days when it rained too heavily because he sent me to read in my room instead of having me stay Outdoors that's no way to make him strong and active she would say sadly as especially that boy who so needs to build up his endurance and willpower my father would shrug his shoulders and study the barometer for he liked meteorology while my mother making no noise so as not to disturb him watched him with a tender respect but not so intently as to try to penetrate the mystery of his Superior qualities but as for my grandmother in all weathers even in a downpour when Francois had rushed the precious wicker armchairs indoors for fear they would get wet we would see her in The Empty rain-lashed Garden pushing back had disordered gray locks so that her forehead could more freely drink in the salubriousness of the wind and the rain she would say at last one can breathe and would roam the soaked paths to symmetrically aligned for her liking by the new Gardener who lacked all feeling for nature and whom my father had been asking since morning if the weather would clear with her jerky enthusiastic little step regulated by the various emotions excited in her soul by the intoxication of the storm the power of good health the stupidity of my upbringing and the symmetry of the gardens rather than by the desire quite unknown to her to spare her plum colored skirt the spots of mud under which it would disappear up to a height that was for her maid always a source of Despair and a problem when these Garden walks of my grandmothers took place after dinner one thing had the power to make a comeback in this was at one of the times when her circular itinerary brought her back periodically like an insect in front of the lights of the little drawing room where the liqueurs were set out on the card table if my great aunt called out to her bet hild come and stop your husband from drinking cognac to tease her in fact she had brought into my father's family so different a mentality that everyone poked fun at her and tormented her since liqueurs were forbidden to my grandfather my great aunt would make him drink a few drops my poor grandmother would come in ardently beg her husband not to taste the cognac he would become angry drink his mouth full despite her and my grandmother would go off again sad discouraged yet smiling for she was so humble at heart and so gentle that her tenderness for others and the little fuss she made over her own person and her sufferings came together in her gaze in a smile in which unlike what one sees in the faces of so many people there was irony only for herself and for all of us a sort of Kiss From The Eyes which could not see those she cherished without caressing them passionately with her gaze this torture my great aunt inflicted on her the spectacle of my grandmother's vein and treaties and of her weakness defeated in advance trying uselessly to take the liqueur glass away from my grandfather were the kinds of things to the sight of which you later became so accustomed that you smile as you contemplate them and take the part of the persecutor resolutely and gaily enough to persuade yourself privately that Lopez execution is involved at that time they filled me with such horror that I would have liked to hit my great aunt but as soon as I heard patil come and stop your husband from drinking cognac already a man in my cowardice I did what we all do once we're grown up when confronted with sufferings and injustices

    "Title": "How to Stop Getting TRIGGERED Forever",
    "Transcript": "The concept of being triggered, though it may at times be overused, sits on top of a hugely important concept in psychological life - which demands our respect, compassion and attention. To be triggered is, in its most basic form, to respond with intense fear and anger to a situation in the here and now which, to other people, may seem blameless and unconcerning. One moment we are calm, the next we are catapulted into despair and terror; only minutes ago, the future looked hopeful, now only ruin and disaster seem to lie ahead. Most of us who suffer from these episodes would very much like to better hold on to equanimity and hope. It may be important to know how to be scared or incensed when situations actually demand it, but - the triggered person typically feels after an episode - it is also deeply counterproductive and plain exhausting to be visited by powerful emotions that aren't warranted by what lies before us and that fail to advance our interests in any way. The way out of being uncontrollably triggered is to understand how the mechanism operates. The mind is triggered when it believes it recognises in the world around it a situation that it feels from memory to be highly damaging and dangerous. Our triggers are a secret guide to our histories; they tell us about things we were once very afraid of. The triggering element is like a piece of a jigsaw that will precisely fit into an analogous puzzle in the past. We are triggered now by what we were devastated by then. Even if we don't remember too much about our past, we can surmise everything we need to know from reverse engineering our triggers. If we are constantly afraid we are going to be excommunicated and mocked, this will - in some form - be exactly what happened to us at some stage long ago. If we're terrified that someone is going to overpower us and not listen to our 'no's', this is an almost sure echo of what we once experienced. The precise relationship between trigger and catalytic event may not always be literally equivalent, there can be some displacement along the way, but the link will be strong all the same. The trigger contains and maps onto a traumatic event. Let's imagine a person who is triggered, that is, thrown into powerful despair and self-loathing, by images on social media of blatantly attractive and popular people. No sooner have they seen these than they start to doubt and despise themselves, reflect on their inadequacies and remember all the reasons why they are fated to be a failure and unloved. The trigger is not entirely 'nothing'. There is something a little dispiriting about the beauty parade on certain sorts of social media. But the point at issue is the scale of the reaction that is generated. In seeking to account for it, we have to look backwards. The person has been triggered because the contemporary event contains, in a garbled, disguised and unconscious form, the essence of a profoundly traumatic dynamic in earlier life which lies mostly unknown and unexplored - and thereby commands immense and unending power over the victim. Let's suppose that this person had a mother who favoured their more ebullient younger sibling over them and that their looks were part of what damned them to horrific neglect and emotional coldness. It doesn't, in the circumstances, take much to be returned back to this place. We are animals who are primed to sniff out in the present the slightest sign of the dangers of the past. The tragedy of triggering is that it fails to notice the differences between then and now; between the awfulness we suffered long ago and the relative innocence of the modern moment. In so far as bad things do happen nowadays, triggering also fails to account for the way in which we are no longer children, and are therefore able to respond to the threats that do come our way with a lot more creativity, strength and calm than we possessed as four or ten year olds. Were things ever to get as bad as they once were, we have so many more options than we did - and therefore so many reasons to feel less agitated and vulnerable. To be triggered is to lose our powers of discrimination. In the heat of the moment, we can longer distinguish between A and B. So frightening is A that everything between it and Q is, at heart, another A. We can't tell that someone is not telling us that we are guilty, that the situation isn't evidence of doom, that we are not being mocked, that our colleague isn't attacking us, that we aren't being reprimanded unbearably, that we haven't been told we're an idiot or a monster. We can't distinguish between looking a bit tired and looking fundamentally unacceptable, between something they've done that got them sent to prison and something we've done that won't ever be noticed. So primed has our history made us to appalling scenarios, we have no ability not to refind them at every turn - especially when we are a little low or tired. Though we might assume that we'd want to escape our triggers, we are also drawn to them through a compulsive sense of familiarity. Calm and confidence aren't our resting places; they don't feel normal and are therefore worrying in their own way. We want our awful hunches confirmed. It can feel right to put ourselves in environments where people might be mocking, to look out for stories of disgrace or ruin or to befriend people who are constantly on the edge of undermining us. When our mood feels eerie and sad, we might go to the very website that triggers us or call up the person we know is going to alarm us. The cure for triggering is love; love understood as a process of patiently holding someone and, like a kindly and soothing parent, helping them to discriminate between black and white, terror and calm, evil and goodness. The cure lies too in learning to work backwards from our current triggers to the dynamics that once created them. Rather than worrying yet more about the future, we should ask ourselves the simple question: What does my fear of what will happen tell me about what did happen? What scenario from my past is contained in my alarm at the future? To overcome our triggers is to come to navigate the present with all the confidence and excited curiosity that should have been ours from the start. And maturity could be defined as: knowing what triggers us and why - and a commitment to dampening our first responses in the name of a patient exploration and understanding of the past."

    "Title": "The Secret Book to Win Friends and Influence People",
    "Transcript": "How to win friends and influence people is the title of possibly the most famous book of the twentieth century. It is also one of the books most routinely ridiculed by people who think they are clever. Why one earth would an intelligent person need help with something as basic as that, intellectuals have mocked down the decades. And in any case, good people don't need to win friends; they already have them. And they don't need to 'influence' them, they just need to say important things. But these were not the assumptions of a man far cleverer and more important than intellectual history has been prepared to allow. Born in 1888 into a poor farming family in rural Missouri, Dale Carnegie left school in his teens and rather than attend university he spent years selling bacon and soap to people living on isolated ranches. He then got involved in adult education and spent tens of thousands of evenings giving talks to small audiences in out-of-the-way towns. With over-prominent ears and a prosaic hair-cut Dale Carnegie was almost the anti-type of what we imagine a great and centrally important writer might be like. In 1936, when he was in his late forties, he summed up his views on being nice in a book that was ridiculed by intellectuals: How to Win Friends and Influence people. The issues he addresses are utterly basic: we spend vast parts of our lives trying to build relationships, hoping to get others to appreciate who we are, to understand us and grasp what we have to offer them; and yet our efforts are, so often, far from successful. Carnegie pinpointed things we desperately need to know and get good at but which had been largely neglected by previous writers. What he suggests sounds entirely like common sense: smile, remember someone's name, listen to them, think about what they want, don't make your success come at the price of theirs; don't tell others they are wrong, get to understand (and appreciate) why they think as they do - especially if it strikes you as misguided. And yet, these are precisely the things we generally forget to do. He recognised, with astonishing clarity, how naive-sounding the advice we need really is. Our culture wants us to imagine that what we need to know are very complicated things: a University will make sure its science students understand the Theory of Relativity or that its Humanities graduates are acquainted with Foucault's views on 19th century prisons. We're quite good at abstruse things. And yet we trip up on issues that are diametrically opposite in character: that are simple, emotional, interpersonal. They involve not demonstrating how much we know, but rather showing how much we can like other people. Knowledge of the truth is a tiny fraction of what it takes to make truth effective in the world. What we need in spades is charm and an ability to persuade others that we are on their side. It is never enough to feel haughtily superior or, as unfortunately, pessimistically inferior - and simply wait for others to come to us. We have to master the art of winning people over to our side. We are persuaded to change our minds only by people we like and who we feel love and understand us: that is, by people who have taken Carnegie's vital lessons to heart."

    "Title": "How to Find Out What You Really Really Think and Why...",
    "Transcript": "It's one of the great paradoxes of mental life that we're often unable to access our true feelings about important matters. What we really think about — for example — the character of a friend, or the next best move we should make in our career or our stance towards an incident in childhood… all of our conclusions on such critical topics can remain locked inside us, part of us but inaccessible to ordinary consciousness. What we operate with instead are surface and misleading pictures of our dispositions and goals. We may settle, in haste or fear, on the most obvious answers: our new friend is very kind, we should aim for the most highly paid job, our childhood was 'fun'. We ignore our deep truths first and foremost because we aren't trained to solicit them; no one ever quite tells us that we might need to exhibit the patience and wylyness of an angler while waiting at the river bank of our deep minds. We've been brought up to act fast, to assume that we know everything immediately, and to ignore that consciousness is made up of layers, and that it's the lower strata that may contain the richest, most faithful material. We may also be hesitant because the answers that emerge from any descent into the depths and subsequent communion with our inner pilot can sound at odds with the settled expectations we have of ourselves in daylight. It might turn out that we don't, in fact, love who we're meant to love, or are scared and suspicious of someone who is pressing us to trust them or are deeply moved by — and sympathetic to — a person we hardly know. It's the profoundly challenging nature of our conclusions that keeps us away from our inner sanctum. We prioritise a sense of feeling normal over the jolting realisations of the true self. The steps we need to take in order to check in with ourselves are not especially complicated. We need to make time, as often as once a day, to lie very still on our own somewhere, probably in bed or maybe in the bath, to close our eyes and direct our attention towards one of many tangled or murky topics that deserve reflection: a partner, a work challenge, an invitation, an upcoming trip, a relationship with a child or a parent. We might need a moment to locate our actual concern. Then, disengaged from the ordinary static, we should circle the matter and ask ourselves with unusual guilelessness: 'What is coming up for me here?' Holding the partner, work challenge, invitation or disagreement patiently in mind, we should whisper to ourselves: what do we really think? What is the real issue? What is truly going on? What is actually at stake? We should — to sound a little soft-headed — ask ourselves what our heart is whispering to us or what our gut is trying to articulate. We're striving to access a sincere part of the mind too often crushed by the barking, harried commands of the conformist executive self. What we will almost certainly find is that — in a quasi-mystical way — the answers are already there waiting for us, like the stars that were present all along and only required the sun to fade in order to come to light in the circumference of the sky. We already know — much more accurately than we ever assume — who we should be friends with, what is good and bad for us, and what our purpose on this earth is. We just need to take the time to check in on our true selves."

    "Title": "Freud's Oedipus Complex Can IMPROVE Your Sex Life",
    "Transcript": "The Oedipus Complex is one of the strangest and most counter-intuitive concepts in psychoanalysis. First formulated by Freud in 1899, and taking its name from the mythical Greek tragic hero Oedipus (who in the eponymous play by Sophocles unknowingly sleeps with his mother and then kills his father), it suggests that every child goes through a phase, normally between the ages of three and five, of physically desiring its opposite sex parent while wishing to do away with, or kill, its rivalrous same-sex parent. Expressed bluntly like this, the Complex tends to arouse immediately puzzlement, ridicule - or disgust: children aren't generally to be witnessed expressing any kind of sexual desire and we are unlikely to remember anything in our own lives remotely resembling what Freud insistently describes as a universal truth. However, the explanatory power of the Oedipus Complex is likely to increase - as is often the case with Freud's ideas - the less literally we take it, in other words, the more we view it as providing us with an overall picture of the genesis of human sexuality rather than as a concrete event in a given child's mind. We might think of the Oedipus Complex as offering us a guiding narrative about how we come, through the varied experiences of childhood, to have our own distinctive approach to sexuality. The Complex shines a light on a range of questions: - How confident do we now feel in our powers of attractiveness? - Are we disgusted or broadly at peace with our sexuality? - Do we think that other people are likely to reject or accept our advances? - How much are we intimidated by our desires? What is telling is that a huge range of responses are to be found here: some of us labour under critical degrees of shame and terror. Others have no particular difficulty making our appetites known and acting on them in reciprocal situations. Sex may be a source of exceptional joy - or the locus of boundless masochism and paranoia. With Freud's ideas in mind, rather than imagining that we actually wanted to sleep with anyone as children, we might say that we went through a phase of exploring what it might mean to prove attractive to a man or a woman. Importantly, we did so in the form of a game, one in which we no more wanted things to become real than we would - when we played pirates or jungle explorers in the kitchen - have wished to join an actual Caribbean drug cartel or a trip down the Amazon. Little boys and girls will, in a limited way, try out what happens if they attempt to charm mum or dad; at a given point, they might pull a highly endearing smile and say they want to spend the rest of their life with only one parent, or send the other one away or muse that it might be nice if they could have a little wedding ceremony with one parent only. And here - for better and for worse - the games can unfold very differently according to the emotional maturity of the parent. In an optimal scenario, when a small child initiates a game, the adult will be exceptionally careful neither to shame nor to excite them. They won't say 'Don't be so silly' or 'How repulsive'. They won't get furious or punishing. They will be resolved enough about their own sexuality not to take fright at its first echoes in their child. They will notice what's going on, smile indulgently and go along with the game just long enough for the child to feel acknowledged and heard. And yet they will naturally not do anything remotely seductive back. They will, with great kindness, ensure that the game always stays very much a game. So much is, however, liable to go wrong. There are mothers and fathers too fragile internally to allow a child to flex their faculties of attraction; they get bitter or snide, dismissive or angry; there can only be one chief or one queen bee. There are parents too deeply swallowed up in cares and depression to allow themselves to be charmed. And then there are parents whose loneliness and confusion means they mistake a child's game for some form of genuine desire for sexual contact - with all the obvious tragic life-long repercusions that ensue. If we as adults have difficulties around sex, we might - with Freud's Oedipal concept in mind - ask ourselves some of the following: - How much did I, as a child, feel able to charm my mother or father? - Did they seem to take pleasure in my existence? - Were they angry, sad or simply elsewhere? - Was my same sex parent able to tolerate my games or did they respond with bitterness or bullying? - Concurrently, how much did my parents give me a sense that they knew boundaries and would stop any game when it needed to be stopped? Freud understood that adult mental health depends on the early expressions of our desire having been handled with particular skill by those around us: without excessive punishment or licence, without neglect or enticement, without anger or shame. The healthy adult is someone who can feel potent without being terrified or guilty. Their games went well; now their reality can follow suit. Freud's Oedipal Complex becomes a source of valuable insight once we separate it from its more literal formulations. It might show us why sex has ended up a lot more complicated for us than it should ever have been."

    "Title": "7 Secrets of Therapy",
    "Transcript": "In order to recover from many kinds of mental distress, there's really no alternative but to get acquainted with psychotherapy. Though often dense and complicated, the central ideas of psychotherapy can be summarised as follows: 1. Every human is in part neurotic. A neurosis is any pattern of thinking or behaviour that blocks the full flowering of our personalities and potential. We may be neurotic in love or at work, in our friendships or in our attitudes to creativity or politics. It should be part of every evolved human's mission to seek to understand and unpick the neurotic elements of their own personalities. The enquiry 'And how are you neurotic?' should not be taken as an insult, rather a sensible and kindly request for more information on our particular share of humanity's warps. 2. The origins of most of our neuroses lie in our childhoods - before we were old enough to deploy adult mechanisms to process events. What causes neuroses are incomprehensible, cruel and intolerable frustrations and pains that we can collectively refer to as traumas. A trauma may be as immediately shocking as a rape or as seemingly inocuous as years of continuous petty criticism or emotional neglect; something qualifies as a trauma because of an unmasterable dimension, the child is not able to make sense of the agony it faces - and so suffers a grievous blow to its sense of self and command of trust, intelligence and love. 3. Every parental inadequacy tends to give rise to a neurosis. Where there is an over controlling parent, there will be a child with problems around autonomy. Where there is a belittling parent, there will be a child with difficulties of confidence and self-esteem. Where there is sexual rivalry or seductiveness, there will be issues of guilt or shame. Every character defect on the side of the parent necessarily imposes a toll on a child. 4. There is no such thing as an un-neurotic parent. Rather than deny that they could have done anything 'wrong', all parents must simply put up their hands gracefully, perhaps humorously too, and then assist their child in figuring out the particular difficulties they will have bequeathed to them. 5. Trauma leads to repression which over time inspires the formation of neurotic symptoms. Neuroses that have not been understood continue into perpetuity: time never weakens them. 6. Healing comes through self-awareness. To improve, we need to dynamite the concrete of repression and recover contact with the original trauma. And in order to do that, we need to accept - before anything else - that doing so would be a good idea. We have to agree that self-knowledge will be what can save us. 7. It won't be enough to know the past, we will need to feel it too. We may have a workable sense of the central details of our childhoods, but an intellectual grasp won't be enough. We need to viscerally reexperience rather than merely intellectually know the past so as to free ourselves from its hold. Our neuroses will weaken or dissolve once the traumas that fire them are finally known - and, even more importantly, felt. That is the challenge - and the promise - of psychotherapy."

    "Title": "How Keeping a Diary Can Save You",
    "Transcript": "What should in an ideal world define someone as a writer isn't that they publish books, or give talks at literary festivals or wear black; it's that they belong to a distinct group of people who - whenever they are confused or in distress - gain the greatest possible relief from jotting things down. 'Writers' in the true sense are those who scribble - as opposed to drink, exercise or chat - their way out of pain. The act of writing, especially in a journal or diary, is filled with therapeutic benefits. So deeply do certain ideas threaten the status quo, even if they ultimately offer us benefits, the mind will ruthlessly 'forget' them in the name of a quiet life. But our diaries are a forum in which we can raise and then galvanise ourselves into answering the large questions which lie behind the stewardship of our lives: What do I really want? Should I leave? What do I feel for them? We may not quite know what we want to say until we've started to write; writing begets more writing. The first sentence makes the second one clearer. After a short paragraph that was summoned from apparent air, we start know where this might be going. We learn what we think in the process of being forced to utter ideas outside of our swampy minds. The page becomes a guardian of our authentic elusive self. Here we can make vows and attempt to stick to them: No more humiliation! The end of masochism! Ordinary life can seem to have no place for stock-taking and moments of grand enquiry. But the page demands and rewards them: What am I trying to do? Who am I? What is meaningful for me? We'd never get away with such things at the dinner table, even among people who claim to love us - but here they make sense. We can look back at what we've written and understand. The page is a supreme arena for processing. We can drain pain of its rawness. We can get used to disasters and stabilise joys. We can turn panic into lists. Five ways to survive this. Six things I am going to tell them. Four reasons not to despair. We won't need to be so jittery in the world outside after we have told the notebook all this. The page becomes a laboratory in which to try out what might shock and surprise. Leave the job. Tell them it's over. We don't need to honour everything we say. We're giving it a go and seeing how we feel. It's the first draft of a letter to ourselves. Looking back at what we have written should be embarrassing, if what we mean by that is hyperbolic, disjointed, uncertain and wild. If we aren't appalled by much of what we have said to ourselves, we aren't beginning to be truthful - and therefore won't learn. If in ordinary life we make a little more sense than we might, if we are a bit calmer than we were, it's perhaps because - somewhere in a drawer - there are pages of tightly compressed handwriting that have helped us to understand our pain, safely explore our fantasies and guide us to a more bearable future."

    "Title": "Kierkegaard on Love",
    "Transcript": "One of the most provocative analyses of love ever produced is to be found in the writings of the Danish Existential philosopher Soren Kierkegaard. In a book entitled Works of Love, published in Copenhagen in 1847, Kierkegaard — then thirty-four years old — proposed a theory which deliberately upset every leading idea that his own age (in this respect very similar to our own) liked to entertain about this hallowed concept. First and most importantly, Kierkegaard insisted that most of us have no idea what love is — even though we refer to the term incessantly. The first half of the nineteenth century in Europe saw the triumph of what we today call 'Romantic love', involving a veneration and worship of one very special person with whose soul and body we hope to unite our own. Kierkegaard insisted that through concentrating on Romantic love, we develop a narrow and impoverished sense of what love can actually be. Love is not, Kierkegaard insisted, the special excitement we feel when in the presence of someone unusually beautiful, pure, clever or accomplished. He proposed that we return instead to an exacting version of Christian love, which commands us to love everyone, starting — most arduously — with all those who we by instinct consider to be unworthy of love. He made a distinction between what in Danish is termed kaerlighed — true love, the kind Christians are commanded to give and elskov — erotic love. For Kierkegaard, we should learn to love all the many people it would be so tempting to curse and to hate; those whom we believe are mistaken, ugly, irritating, venal, wrong-headed or ridiculous; those who may have made some truly serious mistakes and offended our moral codes. To learn to love such people, to practise kaerlighed, this is the real accomplishment — and the summit of our humanity. It is love when we can look at someone who appears misguided, lazy, entitled, angry or proud and instead of labelling them despicable, can wonder with imagination and sympathy how they might have come to be this way; when we can perceive the lost, vulnerable or hurt child that must lie somewhere within the perplexing or dispiriting adult. Love means making the effort to extend our compassion beyond the bounds of attraction so that we may look generously on all those we might at first glance have deemed beyond the pale or 'undeserving'. Kierkegaard tells us that if we understood love properly, when we said we loved a person, we wouldn't mean that we admired them but that we had a handle on all the many difficulties that underpinned their troubling and objectionable sides. Kierkegaard was especially aggrieved by how his contemporaries had replaced the Christian-inspired emphasis on forgiveness with the pursuit of something that feels a great deal more objective, hard-edged and rational: justice. The pursuers of justice want to give everyone what they actually deserve. This sounds extremely reasonable — until one comes face to face with an uncomfortable fact: that if we all actually ended up with what we truly 'deserved', the world would at once be rendered entirely unlivable. The attempt to pursue justice at all costs, and the belief that doing so is theoretically possible, gives rise to appalling intolerance, for if one really believes that one can be a flawless instrument of righteousness, then there is logically no limit to the degree of rage or the sternness of punishments that can be brought to bear upon 'wrong doers'. For Kierkegaard, our goal should not be to create a world in which everyone gets exactly what they deserve; it is to try to ensure that as many of us as possible get the kindness we need. Applied to children, concepts of justice quickly reveal their absurdities, Kierkegaard could see. If parents were to give their children exactly what they 'deserved', most small people would at a stroke be put out on hillsides to die. The pursuit of justice may spring from the noblest of motives but it is a quick route to an unloving hell. Kierkegaard proposed that there is a ladder of love, from the most undemanding to the true. On the first rung of the ladder, we love those who love us; then we love those who do not love us, then we love those who persecute us and finally, and triumphantly, we should love everyone without exception. Kierkegaard mocks those who say they believe in love but add that they haven't found someone they can love. There are millions of people around. If we say that they are not worthy of love, we haven't understood love. We need to love those we can actually see, not 'invisible beings.' A Kierkegaardian dating site would force us to love utterly random candidates, not based on admiration or virtue, but on the basis of our shared humanity. He bemoaned 'the selfishness of preferential love.' 'Christianity has never taught that one must admire his neighbour,' he wrote, 'one shall simply love him.' Kierkegaard detects an appalling snobbishness in Romantic love. People who otherwise pride themselves on their lack of prejudice will apply terrifyingly strict criteria to their choice of partner: they want someone with just a certain sort of face or income or sense of humour. They think of themselves as kind and tolerant but when it comes to love, they have all the broad-mindedness of a believer in 'a caste system whereby men are inhumanly separated through the distinctions of earthly life.' Kierkegaard adds: 'Christians don't only love the poor; they love everyone. The rich, the corrupt, the powerful: “He who in truth loves his neighbour loves also his enemy…” Love is the fulfilment of a law…' Kierkegaard talks about Christ's love for his disciple Peter, who repeatedly lets him down: 'Christ did not say: “Peter must change first and become another man before I can love him again.” No, just the opposite, he said: “Peter is Peter, and I love him; love if anything will help him to become another man.”' So, in imitation of Christ, we should love people especially if they are hateful: doing something hateful does not disqualify anyone from love, in fact it makes them all the more deserving of it. 'We speak continually about perfection and the perfect person. But Christianity […] speaks about being the perfect person who limitlessly loves the person he sees […] with all his imperfections and weaknesses.' Ultimately, Kierkegaard wants us to do something that sounds both utterly odd and yet entirely kind: 'To be a Christian means to be the imitator of Christ […] and to be an imitator means that your life has as much similarity to his as it is possible to human life to have.' Danish readers of the 1840s who came across Kierkegaard's writings on love must have been as surprised as we are on what this philosopher had to say on the subject — because his perspective is so different from that we ordinarily operate with. But however arduous his message to us may be, we can see how relevant it remains. We too so often get stuck on the idea that we have not found 'the one' and on that basis refuse to love anyone; we too judge and moralise rather than forgive and lend sympathy. We may still be at the dawn of understanding what true love really offers, and requires of, us."

    "Title": "The Ancient Origin of Cancellation",
    "Transcript": "It's natural for most of us to spend time worrying about our reputation: what others think of us, whether we are deemed good or bad by the community… This can quickly become a painful topic, and our thoughts can descend into bonfires of worry: what if we are accused of something, what if we are ostracised and mocked, what about if we become a pariah? A useful way out of the panic was suggested many centuries ago by the Stoic thinkers of Ancient Greece and Rome. They suggested that we divide the topic of reputation into two. On the one hand, who we are and what we think of ourselves. And on the other: what other people may decide to declare or say about us. The Stoics reminded us of an important detail. We can never be certain of the second part of the equation; we can't control the world beyond a certain point. There is always the possibility that someone vengeful, mean or disturbed will say something about us and try to damage us. We can never be completely assured that they won't. This might seem like alarming news, but the Stoics wished us to take it on board with courage and then gain strength from focusing on the first part of the equation: what we think of ourselves. And here, things are far far brighter, because we are far more in control. We can calmly evaluate what we've done, what our hearts are like - and we can then come to a view of what sort of people we are, which provides us with a vital bulwark against the possible vagaries and tempests of public opinion. We have a solid anchor. We know who we are. Modern psychotherapy would add an important detail to this analysis. Our sense of who we feel we are is often highly distorted in a negative direction by our past - which makes us far more jittery about public opinion than is sound. Our sense of self is the result of how other people viewed us in childhood, especially our parents or caregivers. Some of us wander the world with an acute sense of shame and self-distrust that we absolutely don't deserve, and project a lot of paranoia and fear onto others - primarily because we have been treated with disdain in our early years. We will start to feel a lot more solid and immune from the ups and downs of gossip once we become conscious of how negatively biased we have been and settle in our minds what we are worth - irrespective of either what figures from our past said or what someone around us now might suddenly decide. The path to immunity from worry about reputation lies in a more secure and just handle on our own value."

    "Title": "12 Questions to Evaluate your Parents",
    "Transcript": "Some people assume that you can't really say what a good - or indeed a bad - parent actually is. But we don't agree. So we've designed a checklist of what we think makes up a good parent. 1 Firstly and most obvious, a good parent adores their child. They're simply overjoyed that they exist and don't mind telling the offspring that fact, in direct and indirect ways, at small and large moments, pretty much every day. There is no risk of spoiling anyone like this: spoilt people are those who were denied love, not those who were regularly bathed in its calming waters. 2. Secondly, the good parent is attuned to their child; they listen - very closely indeed - to what the small person is trying to say. This means getting down on their knees and calmly paying attention to certain messages that may sometimes sound extremely weird or frustrating. Maybe the child is saying that they are very sad, even though it's their birthday and the parent has gone to enormous trouble with the presents. Maybe they are saying that they are angry with the teacher, even if education is in principle very important and the school was difficult to get into. Children are filled with complicated emotions; a good parents allows these room. 3. A good parent isn't envious of their children. They are strong enough to allow them to have a better life than they did. 4. Good parents are on top of their issues: they don't think it's a good idea to make someone very unhappy because maybe someone else made them miserable long ago. 5. Good parents know about boundaries. The game was hilarious for a long time, but now it's the moment to wind down, to put the paints away, to get back to work or to go up to bed. The good parent doesn't mind being hated for a time in the name of honouring reality. 6. Good parent don't seeming a bit boring and predictable. Small kids don't need excitement and drama from their parents. They want a secure base from which to explore the world. Now we might think back to our pasts and give our carers a score out of ten to measure how things went. It isn't unfair or mean sometimes - in the privacy of our own minds - to hold people to account. Pick up a pen and paper as we run through a list - and score each option out of 10. My Parent… Made me feel deeply loved and wanted. Was often highly attuned to what I actually felt Was able to tolerate a degree of innocent disobedience Was authentically happy about my success Lacked sadistic impulses Avoided imposing too many of their own issues on me Didn't demand to be admired Wasn't too exciting Knew how to play Had boundaries Tolerated dissent Took an interest in my 'small' joys and pains We don't need a score of a hundred and twenty to be robust, but if things were to drop much below sixty, there might be grounds for a good deal of reflection and sorrow. The best thing, if you haven't had a great childhood, is to be as knowledgeable as possible about what went wrong and why."

    "Title": "The Untapped Power Of Psychedelic Therapy",
    "Transcript": "There is a form of therapy which is, right now, in most countries of the world, illegal but which stands to become a dominant way of doing therapy over the coming years and may be the principal route by which many people will heal from their traumas. The reason why psychedelic therapy is likely to prove so important is that it has the power to overcome the central impediment to successful therapy right now. The fundamental thesis of psychotherapy is that we grow ill because there are things inside our minds that we have not been able to confront, feel and think about - and which reside in the unconscious, from where they create vicious disturbances (symptoms, neuroses, hysteria) for our conscious selves. Classically, the task of therapy has been to provide a safe and welcoming forum in which a patient can feel relaxed enough to let the therapist into their imaginations and then make sense of the knots and troubles that lie there. What Freud called the 'fundamental rule' of psychotherapy is that one should be wholly honest with the therapist in sharing whatever happens to enter one's mind: 'Never leave anything out because, for some reason or other, it is unpleasant to tell it,' he advised. This sounds like important, but there is one enormous problem. Most people are entirely unable - when it comes to it - to let down their guard sufficiently to tell the therapist whatever they are feeling. The therapy - and possibilities of healing - are disrupted by our defences. This is where psychedelic substances offer hope. A chemical compound like MDMA does not intoxicate in any simple way. It doesn't, like wine or vodka, place one into a relaxed stupor. It keeps the mind highly alert and clear eyed while at the same time lifting the mechanisms of repression. It allows one to think and feel but also not be afraid or inhibited. The mind can feel brave enough to go to places it would normally shun. Also - for reasons not yet known to scientists - it gives one an appetite for self-exploration (when taken in the right setting, in a quiet room, with music, eyeshades and usually the presence of a kind and curious therapist). We give ourselves the chance - which we might have avoided for many years - to think about tricky aspects of our psyche that need our attention. We may stumble on a powerful need to reflect on a period of childhood, a figure from our past or a difficulty we had scarcely ever dwelt on. At the same time, because we are uninhibited, we don't mind sharing the material. We might write it down, speak it into our phone or tell the therapist. In this way we are able to bring to the surface a rare kind of psychological ore, pure, undistorted and connected up with all our major neurotic symptoms. MDMA is currently illegal all over the world - and can only be experienced in certain safe clinical settings - but it holds out the promise that it will one day make psychotherapy work as well as it always should have done."

    "Title": "Why People Get Mentally Unwell",
    "Transcript": "It sounds really strange to speak of the upsides of being ill. Surely there are only downsides? But rather than assuming, as we normally do, that our mental illnesses are just a problem for us, we can dare to ask in a spirit of open-minded exploration: What are my illnesses doing for me? Whatever their costs, what are their secret upsides? What are their unexpected benefits? Why might I be covertly siding with them against the possibility of health? We often develop psychological illnesses because the alternative to them is in some way worse. The illness protects us - at huge and tragic - cost from a confrontation with something that threatens to be yet more painful and psychologically difficult: the truth about what has happened to us, what we need to do next and the true nature of certain people we are close to. Think of the person who repeatedly fails her exams, despite being very intelligent and driven. What could possibly be the benefit of an illness as awful as self-sabotage? But if we examine this person's life, we might find the presence of a hugely competitive and jealous mother who could be extremely displeased by her daughter's success - and might respond by cutting off her love and becoming highly aggressive. The daughter hence chooses the illness of self-sabotage over the yet more awful realisation that her mother was damaged and damaging and never loved her properly. It can feel 'better' to be ill than realise one was always unloved. Behind a great many psychological illnesses, we uncover “benefits” - if we can put it that way: - failing can be a protection against being envied - worrying about our appearance can distract us from the fact we were made to feel horribly unworthy as a child. - being manically busy can block out uncomfortable news of our true sexual desires - being paranoid can prevent us from acknowledging who we are really annoyed with. - an addiction can keep us ignorant of our early abuse In certain circumstances, getting ill is - to our unconscious minds at least - the easier route. It might not be in any way nice or simple to be always impotent, or worried, or a failure or paranoid, but these options might nevertheless be better than realising that one has an altogether different sexuality or was furious with a supposedly beloved parent or is jealous of a sibling or should be changing jobs or leaving a partner. Behind a great many psychological illnesses, is a highly distressing truth we've exchanged for a neurotic symptom. Once we realise the overall mechanism, we should - whenever an illness comes into view - repeat the naive enquiry: what is the peculiar and particular advantage of this illness for me? What does it prevent me from knowing about myself? What would I need to do if I wasn't ill? What is the upside of feeling depressed, or of blowing up a relationship or of being impotent or friendless? We may generally complain about these problems - but, if we can put it this way, what purpose are they serving for us? We can then dare to think that there is something worse - something truly difficult to swallow - that we are protecting ourselves from via being unwell. The way to overcome a mental affliction is to cease to look at it merely as an explanation-less nuisance. It may be a shield protecting us from what we deep down suspect - mistakenly - would hurt us more."

    "Transcript": "One of the more curious aspects of the ways we are built is that it can take us a very long time indeed to work out what we need in order to be happy. We might assume that the process was obvious; what could be more straightforward than to want. We've ostensibly been doing it since we were four years old and began a powerful campaign for an electric train or set of farmyard animals. The issue is not that we have no appetites but that it can take such a long time for these to become either accurate or authentic. We start by wanting primarily according to what others around us want. Which may mean that - at varied ages - we acquire a bomber jacket, a barbecue set, a marriage, linen trousers, a career in finance, a juicer, a divorce, weekly pilates lessons and a six month cruise around the Pacific. It may be our fourth or fifth decade before, very gradually, we acknowledge just how unexpected, personally flavoured and distinct our characters and requirements really are - and nurture the courage to do something about it. We might grow honest enough to realise that we would be happy never again to see most of the blowhards and fakes we'd been thinking of as 'friends' and giving enthusiastic bear hugs to for years. And, conversely, we might determine that we now want to hang out exclusively with people who've had nervous breakdowns, spent time in prison, know how to cry and actively don't give a damn what the world thinks. We might at the same time realise that we abhor what news and social media do to our minds and - like a cowardly sheep finally kicking the farmer - delete everything, until our phones can barely tell the time any more. We can be proud of all the nonsense that we no longer have to know about or be scared of. The world will go its own merry way and we won't to have follow every part of the bile-filled story at minute intervals. We may also stop trying to impress people we hate. Our mother cared intensely about social status and being famous - and, under her aegis we gave up a great many years of our life. Good for her and a pity for us, but we're done with that now and three weird friends, a big dose of misanthropy and a hut in the woods are beckoning. We are going to be dead pretty soon and all those cancer stories point us in one direction only: towards the need to stop being a craven, imitative, second hand timid flunkey and herd-animal. We need to throw out all the socially prescribed junk and honour the contours of our own beautifully unique characters before it's too late. After a lifetime of imitation, fear, and surrender, we may finally have to grow a backbone - and become loyal to who we actually are."

    "Transcript": "However healthy it often is to try to fit in and assume we must just be like everyone else, there are also benefits in sometimes accepting that we might in the end be simply rather odd - though this needn't be a cause of particularly concern or shame. Perhaps we simply do belong to the peculiar tribe of those who love - above pretty much anything else - to introspect, that is, to try to make sense of themselves, to process their emotions, to analyse their immaturities and to understand the psychological mechanisms they inhabit. We, the happy odd few, belong to that minor clan of the avid self-knowers who take entirely to heart the Ancient Greek command to 'Know yourself'. To be so intensely concerned with self-knowledge has probably equipped us with a number of strange traits. We are likely to very much enjoy our own company. We might not mind spending a whole day alone, marinading in ourselves. It's never a problem if someone cancels dinner on us. We might keep a diary or a file on our computer where we spend hours taking matters apart. We might like hot baths or solitary walks, often in the evening. We might read a lot but in a distinctive way: always looking out for the ways in which the words of others shed light on, and more clearly define, bits of ourselves. We're likely to be impatient with people who seek relentlessly to stay on the surface of things. Probably someone once asked us over dinner - slightly defensively - why we were 'interviewing' them and we weren't at all; we were just directing to them some of the manic curiosity we normally devote to ourselves. In love, half the fun won't be about sex or cuddles, it will be that there is someone there to discuss one of the world's most interesting phenomena - relationships - in real time with us. We might try therapy and even though we may have had our share of disappointing shrinks, it will continue to be an area of intrinsic fascination: many of our favourite books will be psychological ones. As therapy inspires us to do, even though it might have been a long since we lived with our family of birth, we will continue to explore how the past informs our present; we're never quite done with reflecting on mum and dad. We're no longer angry with them as we once were, we're just very interested. People may often try to persuade us to do other things they call fun - go to the beach, come to a party, go shopping - and even though we'll agree and there'll be pleasant moments, the truth is that our favourite pastime remains sitting at home, probably in bed, with a notebook, trying to work out what it means to be alive. That's ideally how - after many years - we'd like death to find us. Not scared or oblivious, but curious and attentive, wondering what we're about to undergo and still speculating on what the brief passage through existence was really all about. We won't have finished knowing ourselves but we'll have been most alive whenever we tried to do so."

    "Transcript": "Part of the pain of growing older is that we can start to see how much, at certain points, we misunderstood ourselves, what the costs of missing self-knowledge were and how beautiful it could be if we could just build ourselves a time machine and go back and correct all our mistakes. It's because - at the age of seven - we had no idea about standing up to an adult that we let ourselves get trampled upon by a parent and then grew up as a target for bullies for much of our lives. It's because at seventeen, we were so uncertain about our value that there was no way we could seduce someone we liked and wasted what might have been some of our most promising years in loneliness and self-hatred. It's because at thirty, we couldn't understand how our romantic tastes had been formed by our family histories that we embarked on an incautious relationship that spoilt multiple lives. The better responses, when we do finally achieve them, are so simple as to be almost insulting. But something can be no less crucial for sounding 'minor': a missing screw can, after all, bring down a 55 tonne airliner. We may realise - far too late - that we need to believe in ourselves, overcome the snobbishness of our parents, correct the distorted images we have of figures of authority, stop worrying what others think, live by our own values and be free. If only we could land our elegant time machine next to our younger selves and whisper them such advice: we'd have left home with our dignity intact, we'd have had the love we craved, we'd have spared ourselves relationship agonies. It's so tantalising, no wonder we often stay up late fantasising about being able to go back in our time machine knowing then what we know now. But not picking up keys lessons wasn't a casual oversight. Wise lessons were around, but we weren't ready. Our inattention was inevitable rather than accidental. We might have laughed defensively if someone had suggested going to psychotherapy aged seventeen. We would have called emotional intelligence 'psychobabble.' We were wedded to our illnesses. We might try to be kinder to ourselves by recalibrating how easy certain emotional steps ever really are. They can certainly be summed up to sound simple. But there is nothing at all simple about correcting mental unwellness. It can legitimately be the work of a lifetime, to one day be able feel fundamentally content with ourselves, not scared all the time, reconciled to our careers and holding the hand of an ordinary kind clever person who loves us and whom we love. That only ever looks easy; in reality, there's nothing more complicated in the universe."

    "Title": "The Paranoia Test",
    "Transcript": "One of the most useful realisations we might come to about ourselves is that we are 'paranoid.' The word is easy to laugh off as impossibly eccentric, evoking people who insist that they are being tailed by the secret service or watched over by an alien species. But the reality is lot more normal-looking and far less comedic-feeling. To be paranoid in the true sense is to suffer from a repeated feeling that most people hate us, that most situations are extremely dangerous and that some kind of catastrophe is likely to befall us soon. It may not be immediately obvious what connects up - for example - our impression that a colleague is taking us for a fool, with our fear of being talked about unkindly by our friends, with our impression that the waiter has deliberately placed us at the worst table and our dread that we're about to be caught up in a scandal. But our sense that the world is permanently and imminently conspiring to belittle, attack and humiliate us is most likely the outcome of a very particular string of experiences of belittlement, attack and humiliation that will have occurred at the hands of just one or two people in our formative years - and yet that will have been carefully submerged and overlooked. And this will have been done because we have implicitly preferred to fear the world rather than acknowledge the reality of the torment we underwent at the hands of characters - who might also be our mother or father - whom we would have liked so much to trust and to love. It's unfortunate that our minds need to discharge their toxins somewhere and that if they have been blocked from doing so in the appropriate location, they will seek to do so anywhere that feels remotely relevant: the office or the restaurant, the party or the newspaper article. The hatred and viciousness we fear from colleagues, friends or social media is only a proxy for what we once received from sources close to home - and which we have lacked the support required to return back to their senders. Understanding who has crushed and scarred us constitutes a critical part of adult self-knowledge. It is also - we should recognise - an insight we may be deeply reluctant to secure, opting to be forever terrified rather than raise arguments against our treatment by care-givers whom we have chosen to believe are innocent. It may one day feel as though far fewer people are actually laughing at us and that there is far less risk of a scandal soon - once we understand that the mockery and shaming we anticipate for tomorrow already unfolded in our heartrendingly anguished and unexplored yesterdays."

    "Transcript": "We're unlucky enough if we meet with people who want to do us wrong, show us contempt and take advantage of us. But this is as nothing next to the monumental bad luck of encountering people who do all this to us while also being extremely skilled at pretending that they aren't; those master manipulators who are at once innocent-seeming and, deep down, profoundly scheming. These people won't only hurt us, they will do something far worse: rob us of our understanding of ourselves, strip us of basic trust and, along the way, for a time, make us lose our minds. However good we might be at fighting overt antagonists, many of us are constitutionally unprepared to detect ones that have entered our intimate lives; we expect and can deal with enemies at the office, but the bedroom feels like a sanctum where our guard is down. Yet this doesn't mean that some very dark things can't unfold there. There are people we can take up with who have been so badly hurt by something in their early lives that they are committed to exacting revenge on anyone who comes too close to them: they may semi-consciously be seeking to exorcise on their partners a latent rage against a dead or depressed parent, they may want to punish a bullying sibling or release themselves from a sense of intolerable vulnerability created by an incident of early abuse. Such dark possibilities are rarely spoken of in useful terms. There are plenty of popular references to 'psychos' and 'lunatics' but far fewer patient analyses of how exactly other minds can be distorted and how widespread longings for vengeance may be beneath smiles and good manners. When we meet with difficulties, we have two explanations to fall back on: the first is to doubt ourselves. The second is to wonder whether, and how, the other person might be ill. If we almost always pick the former, it's because of how familiar and reassuring it is not to take our own sides. It is so much easier for us to think that we are (as they also quickly tell us) irrationally prone to anger, over-excited, 'insane' and complaining for no reason - rather than deep in a relationship with a cruel soul. Those who are most prone to being gaslit in adult love are, sadly of course, the very people who may have been gaslit by their own parents. The idea sounds yet more curious, but parents too can be adept at polishing their reputations and will insist that they are kind - while simultaneously expending enormous hostility on their thoroughly confused child. Despite decades of training in self-doubt, we may need to do a remarkable thing: trust in what our unhappiness is telling us about those we think of as good. The test isn't whether they tell us they love us, it's how at peace they make us feel. We may have to accept that the world is filled with some very dangerous people who look entirely safe to our fatefully untrained eyes. We may need to think a bit less badly of ourselves and substantially worse of some sweet-seeming characters who claim with great sincerity to love us - and don't."

    "Title": "Why We Are All Addicts",
    "Transcript": "When we think of an 'addict', certain stock images come to mind: a homeless person in the park sniffing glue, a gaunt figure with a heroin needle in their arm, a breakfast-time vodka drinker… But such gothic characterisations mask what is in reality a far more universal and less overtly dramatic - though still pernicious - phenomenon. Addiction doesn't have anything to do with what one is addicted to: it can't be neatly circumscribed to those who rely on hard drugs or alcohol. In its essence, addiction simply means leaning on something - it could be anything - because it prevents particular ideas from coming into our minds. The addict relies on their chosen pursuit to block unwelcome emotions from storming the theatre of their consciousness. The particular object of their addiction might be whisky or marijuana, but it could just as well be their mobile phone or ever more copious buckets of fried chicken. One can be addicted to talking to one's mother or cleaning cupboards, doing the accounts or tracking migrating birds. What the addict fears above all is to be left alone, to have nothing to do other than to turn into themselves and to face unbearable sadness or regret, fear or longing. The popular misunderstanding of what addiction is lets too many of us off the hook. It allows people to claim that they are merely going to the office again or checking the news, toning at the gym or catching up on football results. Yet addicts are not evil or weak. They are first and foremost scared. The solution shouldn't - therefore - involve censorship and lectures, rather love and reassurance. We should make moves to allow people to feel as safe as possible about opening more doors in their minds and confident that they can handle whatever might be skulking inside. It is never really fried chicken or social media updates we like anyway: we are just at a loss as to how to begin to reflect without terror on the course of our lives."

    "Title": "How to Get in Touch With Your Feelings... and Why It Matters",
    "Transcript": "The idea that we might - as the expression has it - 'lose touch with our feelings' is, when we reflect on it, a highly paradoxical one. How could we lose touch with feelings that belong to us? Where might they go? And what might be driving their loss? It seems we're built in such a way that an understanding of much of what our minds and bodies go through is in no way automatic; it is mediated via the acceptance and understanding of other people. We know well enough about some things: if, for example, there were to be a gaping wound in our leg, or we hadn't drunk anything for three days, we would know the truth soon enough. But many of our sensations are like bells that have no solid wire back to consciousness; they ring at a peculiar frequency that isn't picked up by our minds when these have been attuned incorrectly. This may, for example, happen around tiredness. Our body may have grown extremely weary over many years but consciousness might simply not be interested, because it's been calibrated to respond only to an agenda which sets store by the fast-paced pursuit of status and money. Or we might feel hugely anxious or in a rage with someone but consciousness, might not care because we have been ordered to be confident or extremely 'good'. Or there might be a profound sadness inside us, but the feeling might not earn our attention, because we're meant to be privileged people with nothing to complain about. Why do we overlook our feelings like this? Because we generally only notice those feelings to which other people, especially people in our childhoods, pay attention to - and conversely ignore those which they sideline or belittle. If no one especially cares that we are worried, if the grounds for our anger would be refused immediately, if there's a dominant assumption that tiredness is for wimps, then we'll follow suit and disdain bits of ourselves as much as others have done. Knowing how to care for ourselves depends on having been cared for by others; we listen to ourselves because people around us have listened to us. Reconnecting with our lost feelings therefore relies on a new, expanded sense of what it might be legitimate to experience. We have to be given permission to give our attention to as much of the sorrow, anxiety, anger or tiredness as may really be locked inside us. Put another way, we have to be loved properly, and so allowed to register whatever we are actually going through without being belittled, stonewalled or humiliated. Love will allow us to enjoy what should always have been our basic privilege: to know what we feel."

    "Title": "If Your Parents Didn't Listen to You Properly...",
    "Transcript": "There are few more important tasks for parents than to be able to listen properly to their children, that is, pick up on and give room to, their children's moods, hatreds and enthusiasms, even when these run contrary to their own inclinations. It's on the basis of having been listened to with close sympathy and imagination that a child will later on be able to accept themselves, remain in touch with what they feel and find partners who are interested in their core selves. Why should listening properly prove so hard for many parents? Partly because what children say and do can prove so threatening to parents' sense of their identity. We may as parents have said a very firm goodbye to vulnerability, imagination, frankness, sexual fluidity or sadness. But our children come into the world unaware of any such repudiations; what we have put into our shadow sides may lie in the midday sun of our offspring's young lives. The kids have no compunction saying that granny is a big fat poo, that they want to dress like an opposite gender or that they long to live in a bigger house. They may in addition be terrible at maths and hopeless at tying their own shoelaces. This may rattle us to the core: how could we have worked so hard to expunge weakness from our personality, only for it to show up in the next generation? How can they be so shockingly needy and difficult, so illogical and impolite? There can be jealousy behind much of the resulting non-listening. Parents may not take their children's cries to heart because no one paid particular attention to their own lamentations. Why would they be patient with another's petty sorrows when they had to grow up with brutal speed? The best way for parents to protect themselves against registering their latent frustrations and regrets can be to ensure that their children also don't get what they want. Non-listening parents are to be found constantly rewriting their children's experiences: 'That's nonsense,' they will say, 'I know you love going for walks in the rain!' Or: 'Why would my brave little soldier cry about something like that!' Or they'll insinuate that there is simply no way to devote oneself to something (ballet or business, being shy or dressing as a fairy) and remain legitimate and loveable. The legacy of not being listened to is a split personality, in which we are unable to allow in the sadness or anger, vulnerability or confidence that our parents once denied in us. Properly growing up may involve asking ourselves a very unfamiliar question - what sides of me could my parents not accept? - and making friends with the answers."

    "Title": "When You Are Feeling Quiet and Numb",
    "Transcript": "Every year, nature quietly takes us through a moral lesson that has much to teach us about how we might relate to certain of the more dispiriting and despair-inducing moments in our own development. Beginning in mid-October in the northern hemisphere, the temperature drops, the nights draw in, the earth turns cold and hard, fog lies low over the land and rain drives hard across the austere, comatose grey-brown landscape. There is nothing immediate we can hope for; now we have nothing to do but wait, with resigned patience, until something better shows up. Far more than we can generally accept, our minds too have cycles. We cannot be permanently fruitful or creative, excited or open. There are necessary times of retrenchment when, whatever we might desire, there seems no alternative but to stop. We can no longer be productive; we lose direction and inspiration. We are immovably numb and sterile. It can be easy to panic: why should such a paralysed and detached mood have descended on our formerly lively minds? Where have all our ideas and hopes gone? What has happened to our previous animation and gladness? We should at such times take reassurance from the late November landscape. Certainly things are lifeless, cold and in suspension. But this is not the end of the story; the earth is like this not as a destination but as a phase. The deadness is a prelude to new life; the fallow period is a guarantor of fecund days to come. All living organisms need to recharge themselves, old leaves have to give way, tired limbs must rest. The dance and ferment could not go on. It may look as if nothing at all is happening, as though this is a trance without purpose. Yet, deep underground, at this very moment, nutrients are being gathered, the groundwork for future ebullience and dynamism is being laid down, another summer is very slowly collecting its strength. As nature seeks to tell us, we cannot permanently be in flower. We need moments of repose and confusion. There is nothing to fear. Things will re-emerge. We should make our peace with our own midwinters - and lean on nature's wise accommodation to strengthen us in our pursuit of serenity and patience."

    "Transcript": "The problem with libraries is that they can be so large, impressive, and filled with knowledge that they unwittingly embed in us an idea that everything worth registering, everything valuable and true, must lie 'out there', must already have been classed on a shelf with an index number to await our discovery the moment we cease to be so preoccupied with ourselves. But what this modest, respectful and quietly self-hating conclusion disguises is that each one of us is an unparalleled and superlative center of knowledge in and of ourselves; our minds have more ideas stored in them than are to be found in the collective catalogues of the Biblioteca Geral da Universidade de Coimbra, the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York and the British library in London; we have vaults filled with a greater number of moving and beautiful scenes than those of the world's greatest museums put together. We are just failing to wander the stacks and galleries as often as we should; we are failing to notice what we have seen. So convinced are we that insights of worth lie beyond us, we have omitted to consult the treasury of thoughts and visions generated every hour by our endlessly brilliant, fatefully unexplored minds. The American essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson once remarked: 'In the minds of geniuses, we find - once more - our own neglected thoughts.' In other words, geniuses don't have thoughts that are in the end so very different from our own; they have simply had the confidence to take them more seriously. Rather than imagining that their minds are only a pale shadow of the minds of infinitely greater thinkers who lived and died elsewhere long ago, they have been respectful enough of their existence to conceive that one or two properly valuable ideas might plausibly chose to alight in the familiar aviary of their own intelligences. Thinking is – in a way we generally refuse to imagine – a truly democratic activity. We all have very similar and very able minds; where geniuses differ is in their more confident inclinations to study them properly."

    "Title": "Should I Choose Passion or Duty?",
    "Transcript": "When it comes to deciding what to do with our lives, we are frequently presented with what looks like a very painful choice: the passionate path vs the safe path. The latter involves the slow mastery of a dependable profession; we will be bored - but we know we'll never be fired. Meanwhile, the former is a high-wire act in which we fantasise generating an income from what we deeply love and yet we constantly fear penury and humiliation. The choice can feel acute, but it may be less so than it seems, once we properly explore the concept of safety. We are never properly safe so long as we are doing something we hate or are pursuing out of cowardice. In the deeply competitive conditions of modernity, our back-up career - the one we adopt out of fear - will be someone else's central ambition; our plan B will be someone else's plan A, which places us at an immediate disadvantage in terms of the energy and focus we are able to muster. The 'safe' choice might ruin us. By contrast, what we love is what we are obsessed by anyway, we'd do it for free - which decisively increases our chances of mastery while reducing the price of failure. A decade of mixed results on a passion-project is inherently less onerous than unspectacular returns for a whole career in a hateful field. It is in the end not very safe to use the one life we have forcing ourselves to do what we know from the outset we won't enjoy - simply in order to keep living. This isn't safety; it's masochism. We may all have to spend our first two decades suffering through the education system; but at some point, we are allowed to leave school; at some point, we need to have a shot at answering what life could be about beyond obedience and timidity. It is not very common to have a passion; most of us don't. Yet if we are blessed enough to have one, we are risking far more than we should by failing to heed its call."

    "Title": "Stop Trying to Be Nice All the Time",
    "Transcript": "It's natural and beautiful to strive to be a nice person. In a world full of cruelty and thoughtlessness, nice people are committed to being generous, sympathetic and gentle. They never want to cause anyone to feel defeated or to lose sleep. They will go to great lengths to spare others tears. It sounds especially lovely. Nevertheless, it seems impossible to go through the whole of life being nothing but kind. Sooner or later, we are all called upon to take decisions that, even as they protect things we very much care about, will ruffle feathers, generate upset and may lead us to be (at least for a time) violently hated in some quarters. We might, for example, have to tell a romantic partner that, in spite of our deep affection for them, we don't see ourselves being together for the long term. Or we might have to tell a child that it's now bedtime and that there can be no more stories. Or we might have to explain to a colleague that we don't see them fitting into a team and that they might be better off looking for opportunities elsewhere. Such situations can be agony for committedly 'nice' people. There are great temptations to delay the moment of truth or avoid it altogether. The 'nice' still deep down hope that they might - while always smiling and agreeing - stay friends with everyone. Their distinctive sensitivity has often have been fostered by childhoods in which the consequences of being honest and forthright were especially difficult. They might have had a parent who flew into a rage or threatened suicide whenever an awkward idea was laid before them - perfect preparation for an adulthood in which there appears to be no option but to tell everyone what they want to hear. However, being truly nice involves something 'nicer' still than constant agreement and emollience. It means signalling to others what one's value system is and sticking by it, even at the occasional cost of public opposition. It means taking on the burden of telling others where we stand and ruining their afternoon or month in order to save their long-term future and our own. It means accepting that there might be choices to be made between loyalty and sincerity and effectiveness and bonhomie. Mature people have come to terms with the tragic need to acquire something even more important than popularity: a character. Our book, 'On Confidence' walks us around the key issues that stop us from making more of our potential."

    "Title": "Stop Taking Your Fears to Social Media",
    "Transcript": "Early on in every life, a child will look up and - implicitly - ask the world: Am I OK? Do I deserve goodwill and sympathy? Am I on track? And, most commonly, the person who first answers these questions is a parent. Perhaps this parent happens to be generous and sympathetic, they are warm and understanding of the challenges of being alive - in which case the child develops an easy conscience. In the years to come, they appraise themselves with benignancy, they don't continuously have to wonder whether they have a right to exist. They are comfortably on their own side. But if the parent is more punitive, the picture grows darker: approval is always uncertain, there is a constant fear of being called arrogant or of being upbraided for something one hadn't thought about. What's tricky is that consciences don't stay neatly identified with those who kickstarted them. It's rare to find an adult who actively still wonders what their parents think. But that isn't to say that we aren't wondering about our value in more general terms. It's just that we may, without noticing, have taken the question somewhere else - and very often, to particularly harsh modern figure of authority: media and social media. To this pitiless arena, the self-doubting person now directs all their fears of unworthiness and panicked desire for reassurance. To a system set up to reward sadism and malice, they constantly raise their phones and implicitly ask: Do I deserve to exist? Am I OK? Am I beautiful or respectable enough? And, because social media is built on the troubles of the individual soul, the verdict is never a reliable yes. One is never done with cycles of fear and reassurance-seeking. Every time their spirits sink (which is often), the self-doubting sufferer picks up their phone and begs to know whether they have permission to go on. If this might be us, we should grow curious about, and jealous of, people who are free. They are so because someone long ago settled the question of what they were worth and the answer has seemed solid ever since. Social media is a roar in the next valley, not a mob in their own mind. Learning from these calm souls won't just involve deleting a few apps, we will have to go further upstream, back to the baby self, whose alarmed enquiries we must quiet once and for all with ample doses of soothing, and till-now absent kindness."

    "Title": "Eastern Vs Western Ideas of Happiness",
    "Transcript": "The Western intellectual tradition suggests that in order to be happy, what we need to do most of all is to go out and subdue the world; secure resources, found businesses, run governments, gain fame and conquer nations. By contrast, the Eastern tradition has for a long while told us something very different. In both its Buddhist and Hindu strands, it has insisted that contentment requires us to learn to conquer not the world but the instrument through which we view this world, namely our minds. It won't matter, says the East, how lustrous and perfect our achievements end up being - how much money we accumulate, how many friends we acquire - so long as our minds remain open to being troubled at any point by our emotional faculties. All the benefits of a palace with seven reflecting pools and gardens planted with almond and cherry trees will be wiped out by a depression. Chronic anxiety will spoil the ownership of the fastest jet. A fortune is of no use at all so long as one is nagged by paranoia. An unhappy relationship at once destroys any advantages of an esteemed name. Given this vulnerability of external goods to the vagaries of the mental realm, the Eastern tradition advises us to stop spending our time trying to rearrange the material building blocks of existence only then to fall foul of psychological ills - and to focus instead on learning how to control and manage the inherently unruly and hugely complicated instrument through which the external world reaches consciousness. Rather than striving to build empires, we need to spend many years examining how we think and dream; we have to reflect on our families, the economic systems we were brought up under, the impact of our sexual urges and the biological and cosmological order of nature of which we are an infinitesimal part. We have to learn how to breathe in such a way as to allow maximal oxygen to reach our frontal context and to hold our bodies so that our organs are not crushed and our blood flow subtly impeded. We need to be able to sleep a regular number of hours and remove all distractions and excitements that might disturb our streams of thought. This is by no means an easy set of priorities; it is indeed as much hard work as managing a law firm. But, the yogis and sages advise that it delivers us a far more secure hold on the actual ingredients of contentment than the bank account of a newly installed CEO with a yacht off Barbuda. Some of the reason why this continues to feel unreal is that we simply can't imagine that success, great wealth and a palace wouldn't in the end do the trick. And that in turn is because too few people who have been blessed with such accoutrements have ever given us an honest account of what it felt like to have them. Intellectual history, with its dire incantations against a worldly life, has been written by a set of suspiciously poor and envious-sounding people. It is therefore highly fortuitous and extremely reassuring that Buddhism should have been founded by a disgruntled former playboy, Siddhartha Gautama, who once had a palace and a trust fund, fame and servants, but gave them up to sit under a bodhi tree and could therefore tell us, with the benefit of lived experience, what material goods can really do - and not do - for us. And without false modesty, he insisted that they won't be enough. The food may be tasty and the rooms elegant but such advantages cannot serve their purpose so long as one's mind is haunted and unsteady, as it invariably will be without a long emotional education and regular spiritual practice. We should take the East's warnings seriously. However hard we strive, it is logical that we can only be as happy as our minds are at peace. And given how vulnerable we are to mental disturbances, and how short our lives are, we should on balance almost certainly spend a little more time on our psyches and a little less time on our plans for a second home and a New York office. The West has produced too many unhappy playboys, and the East too many genuinely peaceful sages, for us not to shift our attention away from conquering the world towards taming our minds."

    "Title": "How To Be An Interesting Person",
    "Transcript": "Many of us crave to be more interesting people. The question is how we might become so. We rightly tend to associate being 'interesting' with achieving difference from the norm: with being able to serve up some unusual and intriguing stories and ideas. But what might be the best way to lay our hands on these? One prestigious thesis tells us that we should try our best to root out new and well-reviewed books and articles, travel to remote places and befriend people who are prominent in the arts and business. This correctly latches on to something - that we should aim to be different - but it entirely overlooks that, before we've ever read a single book, gone to any foreign country or met any Nobel Prize laureates, we are all compellingly different anyway. The problem is that we just don't allow ourselves to come across as such. To get a taste for this pre-existing level of originality, imagine if we placed a microphone in any of our minds and listened closely in on the chatter. We would quickly find the most surprising, and authentically gripping information: we'd realise that we were attracted to some very unexpected people, often just the sort we weren't supposed to have any feelings for. We'd realise that we had some hilariously personal (and shocking) takes on politics and society - and that we didn't agree with most of the standard lines proposed to us by the media. Our anxieties, fears, hopes and excitements would show a properly distinctive and captivating pattern. We are - though we try so hard never to admit this to ourselves let alone anyone else - already a real character. We understand this point in relation to children. Every child under seven is fascinating. They almost never do anything interesting in the outside world, but it's the honest, uncensored way in which they report on their inner lives that guarantees their interest. When they chit chat about their granny or their teacher or their take on their dad, we're open mouthed. We were once fascinating too, before we got overly worried about seeming normal. There are of course some things that we should - as we grow up - take care not to mention to spare others hurt, but a lot fewer than we think. When we next fear coming across as dull, we need only lean in more closely on the data from our deep selves: we should, and the habit may require a little conscious effort to develop, get in touch with what we actually believe. What emerges may sound odd, but it is also liable to be hugely charming, warm-hearted and comforting - and a lot closer to what people around the table deep down feel too than what was printed in today's newspaper. Everyone is interesting. So-called interesting people are simply those who've allowed themselves to listen in on and share with others a selection of what is really going through their minds. They have not allowed self-hatred and self-suspicion to block them from disclosing their reality. They have been confident enough to imagine that the truth about themselves could be a pleasure for others to hear - and, with a few obvious caveats, it almost certainly will be."

    "Title": "Which Long-term Relationships Will Survive and Which Won't",
    "Transcript": "It can seem very confusing why certain long-term relationships survive and some don't. It can - from afar - look as if it's the most cruel and alarming sort of lottery. Trying to explain love to a child or a visitor from another planet promises to be a perplexing matter indeed: all couples on their wedding day are united in wanting to make things work. Then, for reasons beyond anyone's comprehension, some of them simply seem to dissolve and others don't. To remove some of the terrifying element of apparent chance (and encourage us to work on the right aspects of our own couples), it may be helpful to become deliberately reductive about the real reasons why breakups occur. We need - in this regard - first to discount certain causes that gain far too much airtime relative to their actual likelihoods. Of course, sometimes people break up because one party wants a younger partner. Or because they want better sex. Or because they are seeking a more exciting companion. Or because their hobbies or political views have drifted apart. Or because things have - somehow - grown 'stale.' But let's quickly try to reduce the role we give to such explanatory factors: given the costs of break-ups, given the massive investments that people make in being together, given the chaos generated if there are children, one can assert with a high degree of confidence that almost no one ever splits up for such familiar reasons. The real reason lies elsewhere; the real reason for break up lies in one or both spouse's sense that they have not been heard, that something very important to them has been disregarded, that their point of view has not, at a fundamental level, been acknowledged and honoured. It doesn't matter what the subject of this non-hearing happens to be: it could be that they haven't been heard about their views on money, or on the way the children are being brought up, or on how their weekends should be managed, or on how intimacy occurs or doesn't occur. It's feeling unheard for our differences that is unbearable; it's never the presence of differences per se. We don't break up because a partner doesn't agree with us. We could stand not getting what we want. We could stand a partner who votes another way than we do. Or who is no longer as young as they once were. Or who has annoying friends. Or different tastes in holidays. What we can't stand is someone who blocks us when we try to articulate how troublesome we find these areas of divergence; when our unique way of looking at existence seems a matter of basic indifference, that is too lonely and enraging to bear. It's better to be single than unseen; after all, the unseen are alone anyway, whatever their ostensible relationship status. There is a big difference between a partner not doing what we want and a partner not hearing what we want. It's entirely possible that one would remain with someone who doesn't share most of our interests - so long as they happen to accept, and signal an understanding of, how much these interests matter to us. It would be possible for us to live with someone who doesn't want the same sort of sex as we do (or wants no sex at all), so long as they can at points see matters from our position - and can give a modicum of empathy to our hopes and longings. We could be with someone whose needs for affection run in a different direction, so long as they have the courage to listen to how ours operate. We don't need partners to agree with us on everything; we need them to give off signs that they can accept the scale and legitimacy of our vision. 'I understand' is the phrase that could single-handedly rescue more long-term relationships than any number of anniversary celebrations or therapy sessions; it deserves to known as the most romantic phrase in existence. There is a lot of hope in this thesis. If we want to stay together, we don't need to be exceptionally beautiful or rich. We don't need to rely on chance. We don't have to have brilliant sex or a friction free alignments of interests. We just need to make sure that we are people who listen; who when the partner has something very important they need to get across to us, can bear to take things on board, can bear to acknowledge an opposite position, can bear to say: 'I can see this matters a lot to you… and I will try my hardest to think about it and see what I can do about it.' From here, it really doesn't matter if things radically change or not; the vital work will have been done - and the relationship will have been assured. People described as 'defensive' may have a thousand charms. But we should know that the most flawed open person is preferable to the most seemingly accomplished defensive one. The person we should settle down with isn't the most attractive or the cleverest, it's the one who feels no pride or compunction in readily saying: 'I can hear what you are saying and how much this matters a lot to you… I get it...' Or, 'because I love you, this makes me curious, tell me more…' This person will surely one day annoy or frustrate us mightily (everyone does). We'll just be highly unlikely ever to want to break up with them."

    "Title": "ART/ARCHITECTURE - Louis Kahn",
    "Transcript": "For thousands of years, the most common building materials have been stone, brick and wood. They have also been the most charming, ageing beautifully and suggesting a special kind of nobility and strength. When modernist architecture was born in the early 20th century, traditional materials quickly gave way to the three quintessential modern ingredients: concrete, steel and sheet glass. The result has in far too many cases appeared brutal, uncaring and alienating. The buildings have not aged well either. Could modern architects not learn to work with traditional materials while retaining the forms and the spirit of our own times? This is the question so beautifully answered by one of the greatest of all modernists, the American architect Louis Kahn. Kahn was born in Russia in 1901 and emigrated with his parents to the US at the age of 3. As a young man he studied architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, but his career truly blossomed in the 1950s after a trip to Rome led him to a new appreciation of the beauty of Roman architecture. Kahn's major contribution to modern architecture was to include ancient elements in his work without losing the innovation and clarity of modernism. He reminded the Modernists that they could be in dialogue with their most illustrious predecessors. One symptom of this successful rehabilitation of the old was Kahn's affection for symmetry, which many modern architects had come to view as authoritarian, unimaginative and conformist. Kahn designed the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California as a complex of buildings, identical on either side of a central fountain – a symmetry characteristic of what is known as the Beaux-Arts style. Kahn was unperturbed by this apparent regression. “If people want to see Beaux-Arts it's fine with me,” he said. “I'm as interested in good architecture as anybody else.” Like a city planner for 19th-century Paris or Berlin, Kahn used identical rows of buildings to draw the viewer's eye to the centre of his design, and out beyond it. The fountain that runs through the centre of the Institute aligns with the path of the sun on both the autumnal and vernal equinox. Kahn used symmetry not as an aesthetic default but with great intentionality, to provide one with a sense of balance, focus, and momentum. Kahn also managed to create a sense of grandeur in his designs rarely seen in modern architecture. We might gape at the height of a skyscraper, but it rarely instils the sense of awe that a great cathedral does. Kahn managed to reintroduce a feeling of magnificence into modern works. In the Yale Centre for British Art, he draws the viewer's eyes upward to the high windowed ceiling, much as though it were the dome of a church. Even the staircases create a sense of lofty space and height. Rather than resorting only to steel, concrete, and glass, Kahn regularly sought out a wide variety of older and more sensory materials. He worked with the best consultants to find new uses for ceramic, copper and especially brick. Kahn liked cleverly to juxtapose older and newer materials – like oak with concrete. We tend to associate oak with tradition – Victorian smoking rooms and solemn libraries – while concrete reminds us of impersonal factories and remote, futuristic buildings. But put together, the two mediums demonstrate strikingly different, yet remarkably complementary virtues. The wood gives off a feeling of warmth and domesticity while concrete provides a sense of strength and stability. The combination subtly promises a reconciliation between the old and the new and between comfort and security. Kahn was drawn to the idea of making buildings that would feel like monuments – at a time when most modern architects firmly rejected monuments as both authoritarian and sentimental. In 1938 the architectural critic Lewis Mumford had declared, “if it is a monument it is not modern; if it is modern it cannot be a monument.” But Kahn rather liked the feeling of authority – and was confident enough in his democratic credentials not to mind borrowing from some of the moves of more dictatorial regimes. After his important trip to Rome, he wrote, “I finally realise that the architecture of Italy will remain as the inspirational source of the works of the future…those who don't see it that way ought to look again. Our stuff looks tiny compared to it.” His most substantial building was perhaps the National Assembly in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Though recognisably modern, it also seems in some ways eternal in its massiveness, evoking memories of cathedrals, the great mosques and even the pyramids. Many of Kahn's buildings feel luxurious – but this isn't the luxury of glitz or gold of an oil rich kingdom, rather the luxury of buildings that aspire to still be around in 600 years time; a luxury of eternity. The Kimbell Art Museum in Texas uses travertine marble, white oak and concrete arranged in three 100-foot bays, each fronted by an open, barrel-vaulted portico. It's possibly the most beautiful building in the world. When Kahn died in 1974, he was the most famous architect in the United States, and he remains deeply influential to this day. His ultimate importance lay in his ability to transcend dogmatic modernism and return the best elements of traditional architecture to their rightful place in the canon. He reminds us that the real goal of buildings isn't so much to shock, dazzle or confuse – as to be the equals of the venerable buildings we have long loved in the ancient world."

    "Title": "How You Can Be Too Clever",
    "Transcript": "It is hard to imagine that there could be any such thing as excessive intelligence. After all, most of the problems of the world and of individual lives clearly come down to a shortfall in cleverness - and a surfeit of impulsiveness, self-righteousness and cruelty. Yet it seems that there could still be a way of using our intelligence that cuts us off from necessary encounters with simple truths about us: with humdrum facts, with down-to-earth ideas and appetites, with unglamorous impulses and naive yet profound speculations. If we can put it another way, there might be ways of being intelligent that could - at points - render us distinctively stupid. There is a kind of person we can dub over-intellectual whose very cleverness can encourage them to miss key points. It may make them blind to evident ideas that are nevertheless significant. It may give them a permanent taste for what is abstruse and infinitely subtle - at the expense of anything that doesn't pass an exaggerated threshold of convolution. They may neglect the chance of an interesting conversation with a six year old because their associations of intelligence are rigidly affixed to scholarliness - or they might disdain the offer of a walk with their aunt because she left school at sixteen and has never taken an interest in politics. Their intricate minds may end up misunderstanding reality, which comprises both Ludwig Wittgenstein and hot baths, Immanuel Kant and Dancing Queen, Aristotle and orange and polenta cake. The over-intellectual may spend hours parsing the distinction between freewill and determinism, they may devote themselves to interpreting Maxwell's theory of electricity and magnetism - and yet still be a novice when it comes to explaining their heart or avoiding a sulk. True cleverness means resorting to complexity when, but only when, it is called for - and otherwise keeping room open for ways of speaking and thinking that are appropriately basic and visceral. It may be highly fitting to use riddles and jargon when one is dealing with the operations of a nuclear reactor or the nature time at the edges of the universe. But it becomes a particular form of obtuseness to remain in such a register when unpicking issues in relationships or family dynamics. Those who are properly intelligent can accept that there are central truths about every life that can and should be expressed in the language of a child. It is an achievement enough to sound very clever. It may be an even greater one to know where and when to remain heart-stirringly simple."

    "Title": "What Dating Apps Misunderstand About Love",
    "Transcript": "For most of human history, relationships were relatively simple for a banal yet immovable reason: it was extremely hard to meet anyone acceptable - and everyone knew it. There were only a few people in the village, travel was expensive and social occasions few and far between. This had many drawbacks: it encouraged people to accept offers from suitors they were unconvinced by, it meant that characters who would have delighted each other died lonely and unfulfilled because there were a few mountains or a river between them. Our technologists have used their genius to correct these historic obstacles and provide us with unending choice. Meeting someone new is now a constant possibility. But this breakthrough at the level of introduction has obscured an ongoing challenge at the level of ultimate purpose: we may have become easier to meet, but we are not any easier to love. We remain - each one of us - highly challenging propositions for anyone to take on. All of us are riddled with psychological quirks that serve to render an ongoing relationship extremely problematic: we are impatient, prone to making unjust accusations, rife with self-pity, and unused to expressing our needs in a way they can be understood by others - just to start the list… That we can meet so many people has beautifully obscured our ugly sides, breeding in us the charming yet misleading idea - which engulfs us any time we hit difficulties - that we are in trouble because we have not until now met 'the right person.' The reason why there is friction and longing has, we tell ourselves, nothing to do with certain stubborn infelicities in our own natures or paradoxes in the human condition as a whole, it is only a matter of needing to hunt further for a more reasonable candidate who will, at last, see things our way. The promise of choice has drained us of the patience and modesty necessary to grapple with the tensions that are prone to come our way whomever we might be with. We forget that almost everyone is a charming prospect so long as we know nothing about them. Part of what it takes to be ready for love is to imagine the difficulties that we cannot, as yet, know too much about in detail; the bad moods that will lurk behind the energetic smiles, the difficult pasts that lie beneath the lustrous eyes, the tangled psyches that reside beneath a stated love of camping and the outdoors. Even though there are hundreds of other people we might meet, there are not - in truth - so many people we could really love. Dating apps may have made it infinitely easier to connect but they haven't helped us in any way to be more patient, imaginative, forgiving or empathetic, that is, any more adept at the arts that make any one relationship viable. Most of the issues we experience with a given candidate will therefore show up, in comparable guises, with almost anyone we might stumble upon. The real work we should be doing isn't - once we have had a reasonable look around - to keep trying to meet new people; it's to get to the root of what makes it hard to live with any one person we could alight upon. We will be ready for love when we surrender some of our excited sense of possibility and recognise that though we might have many choices, we don't - in reality - have so many options. It may sound dark, but this will, in its own way, be a liberating realisation that can help us redirect our energies away from the exhausting circuit of new encounters towards a search for the kind of mutual emotional maturity on which true love can one day be built."

    "Title": "4 Great Ideas From Hinduism",
    "Transcript": "Even if we have no interest at all in becoming a Hindu, Hinduism offers us at least four fascinating ideas. 1. LOOK FORWARD TO DEATH Hinduism is hugely radical in suggesting that there is nothing especially noble or interesting about being alive. Once we look at matters dispassionately, a lot of what we have to go through is misery and suffering: we need - with great effort - to grow up, to assume responsibilities, to master a profession, to have a family, to take our place in societies full of backbiting and hypocrisy, to watch those we love get ill and eventually to succumb to old age ourselves. To think highly of 'life' is, through a Hindu lens, a fundamental intellectual error. As Hinduism sees it, our real purpose is to be done with life forever; that is the true summit of existence. Hinduism reverses the Western equation: the sinful and blinkered are forced to live forever, the righteous and awakened are privileged enough to be able to die. If we are not careful, if we do not show sufficient mercy and imagination toward others, we may well - Hinduism suggests - be subjected to the ultimate punishment: we will have to carry on into eternity. The symbol of this ghastly on-goingness is the eight-spoked wheel of 'samsara', the most commonly depicted item in the religion, which evokes the pitiless and unceasing nature of life - to which we are committed unless we take a disciplined series of averting actions which together comprise the central components of Hindu ethics. Hinduism does not suggest that we will carry on forever in our own bodies. According to the process of 'samsara', we are reborn into a succession of different outward envelopes, as each example is eroded away and disintegrated by time. Because samsara is at work across the whole animal kingdom, we might find that our enduring soul ('atman') transmigrates at our death into the body of a woodlouse, a pelican or a house spider (though we might also be reborn as a paediatric nurse or the president). What determines the quality of the migration is the degree of 'karma' or virtue that we have accrued in our lives. Among the many reasons why we might have to be kind to others is an awareness that unkindness might wind us up having to suffer a cycle or two of life as a cockroach or a naked mole rat. The suspicion that life is constantly painful and anxious is one that we largely have to bear in a very lonely way in the philosophies of the West; in those of the East, pessimism is ennobled and takes center stage. We are permitted to feel weary and amply dissatisfied; we have, without quite knowing it, been alive since the start of creation - and it is untenably exhausting and frustrating. The trick, and the true prize, will be to be good and wise enough to learn to die once and for all. 2. REJOIN COSMIC TOTALITY For Hindus, the way to step off the treadmill of eternal existence is to realise that, despite many appearances to the contrary, however paradoxical or absurd the idea might sound, we and the universe are in truth one! From the earliest age, we tend to assume the very opposite. It seems self-evident that we are one kind of thing and the tree over there, the relative over here, the clouds in the sky, the monkey on the parapet and the river wending its way to the sea belong to quite different categories. Yet Hinduism insists that our belief in difference belongs ultimately to a realm of 'maya' or illusion. If we look more deeply into the nature of things, through the help of teaching and spiritual exercises, we stand to discover the remarkable unity of all elements. Unlike what appearances imply, everything we can see and experience around us belong to the same life force: the leaves unfurling on the tree, the child learning to read, the earthworm digging its tunnels, the lava bubbling from the earth, all belong to a single unitary power which only egoistic prejudice has hitherto prevented us from acknowledging as one. Most of our pain, Hinduism argues, arises from an overeager attachment to the difference between ourselves and the rest of the world. We pay inordinate attention to who has slightly more money or respect than we do, we are constantly humiliated by people and events that don't seem to honour our sense of uniqueness. But in a process known as 'moksha' or liberation, we can throw off the veil of illusion that works to separate us from the universe and can start to identify with cosmic totality. It no longer matters exactly where we end and others begin; everything belongs to the same whole that we have mistakenly and unnecessarily carved up into parts. There is a little less reason to grasp, to be puffed up, to be proud or to become embittered. We can survey the course of our lives and of our societies with calm indifference. We can cease to identify happiness with the working out of our will upon the world - and take in with compassion and serenity whatever destiny throws our way. We enjoy 'paripurna-brahmanubhava', the experience of oneness with 'brahman', the principle of all things. Once we have let go of our own ego like this, we may have a few more years left to live, but we can be sure that - eventually - we will not need to keep returning. Constant rebirth is the fate of those who cleave too tightly to their own selves. By contrast, those who have learnt to surrender can at their demise merge with the universe and will never need to suffer the indignities of individual life again. 3. Don't Forget Money Ravi Varma, The Goddess Lakshmi, 1894 We might expect that a religion devoted to spiritual enlightenment would have scant concern for money and possessions. But Hinduism surprises and challenges us by suggesting that - despite everything - what it calls 'artha' or a concern for material prosperity has a place within a wise life. Hinduism is not directing us towards crass materialism. It doesn't want to exhaust us with overly rich foods or attention-seeking displays of wealth. But it is aware - with a touching practicality - that many good and elevated things require a degree of financial support in order to go well. One won't be able to undertake spiritual exercises unless one is able to take a considerable amount of time off from practical duties every day. Meditation on nothingness can be substantially assisted by having a servant or two to take care of the laundry and the housekeeping. Hindus traditionally direct their hopes for material comfort to Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity. One of the most popular of all Hindu deities, she is typically represented holding two lotus flowers that speak of spiritual liberation as well as material good fortune. She is usually accompanied by at least one elephant, a symbol of power and strength, and a swan, an animal that is at home both in the air and in the water, and thereby speaks of an ability to combine competence in the material and spiritual realms. Lakshmi understands, and would never condemn, one's appetite for a better house or a more high paying job. Her role isn't to make us feel guilty about wanting more wealth, it is to remind us that the true point of money is - in the end - to enable us to forget about money. 4. Don't Turn Against Sex Copulating Couple (mithuna), temple carving, thirteenth century, Orissa, Eastern Gangay Dynasty, Northern India https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/38141 We have come to expect very little by way of encouragement or sympathy in relation to sex from religions. At best, a blind eye, at worst, a constant hounding and reminder of the evils of the flesh. But Hinduism surprises us; it made the remarkable step of placing sexual fulfilment - 'kama' - among the four 'puruṣārthas', or aims of human life, alongside 'dharma' (morality), 'artha' (prosperity) and 'moksha' (spiritual liberation). Hinduism's respect for sex was rooted in a particular understanding of what lies behind our erotic feelings. These do not stem - as has so often been alleged - from a base animal impulse; they are a means by which we can sense the unity of the universe ('brahman'). Normally, we live beneath a veil of illusion which persuades us of the separateness of all things, bodies included, but our sexual desires push us to break down the barriers between ourselves and others. We might colloquially say that we are turned on, but through a Hindu lens, at the core of our excitement is the sense that we are breaking down the illusion of separateness and taking a small but important step towards oneness with what we can, without exaggeration, following the religion, term the universe. ****"

    "Title": "Why we should feel sorry for High Achievers",
    "Transcript": "It might seem - at first glance - as though the people we term high-achievers could not possibly require our sympathy or compassion. After all, they are the ones who did exceptionally well in exams, whom the teachers admired, who won places at the best universities, who graduate d with honours, who got into law and medical schools, who founded thriving businesses, who live in the wealthiest parts of town, who are up early in the morning preparing themselves healthy breakfasts before a day of important meetings. Surely we can't suggest that these might be victims? Except, of course, that it would rarely occur to anyone, who did not harbour a high degree of self-suspicion, to undertake so many outsize efforts to impress and to make a mark upon the world. The high achievers, for all their accomplishments, cannot trust in a basic idea: that it might be acceptable to be themselves, outside of any acclaim, notice or distinction. Simply being is never enough, their right to exist can only be assured by constant doing. Their frantic activity masks an underlying unquenchable doubt as to their acceptability. It may have been many years since they enjoyed a day without commitments. The moment that they are at a loose end, anxiety arises: what are they meant to be doing? What have they forgotten to take care of? Do they have the right to be still? No one can doubt what we owe to the high-achievers. They are the ones who build the skyscrapers, who explore distant planets, who drive the stock market to new heights, who start businesses and write films and books. We would all be the poorer without them. But our respect shouldn't rob us of our ability to appraise the costs that their ways of life exact. The wealth of nations is built upon the troubles of the individual psyche. The high achievers have been driven to act not simply from talent or creativity, energy and skill (though these are no doubt present as well) but from a primordial sense that there is something shameful about them in their basic state, and that they must hence clothe themselves in the garments of success to escape the humiliation of their true selves. No wonder that their efforts are so often self-defeating. It may for a long time seem as if they were after money, power, acclaim and distinction but these are merely substitutes for their fundamental, but unknown goal: a sense of basic adequacy. The disjuncture explains the curious sadness that may accompany high achievers at some of their moments of greatest triumph. - Finally they have sold the company. - At last they have won an international prize. But they are likely to feel hollow in the days and years that follow, as they confusedly recognise that every possible achievement has been gained but that none of it has, somehow, been sufficient to quell the pain and restlessness within. It can be counted as close to good fortune if high achievers stumble and fail somewhere along their journey, if they are tripped up by an unexpected bankruptcy, scandal or economic downturn. The reversal may prompt a mental breakdown and a period of rest, in which there is a sliver of hope, for it contains a chance to see that their manic pursuit of success was all along masking a terror about unloveability, which now has a chance to be quelled in more realistic and effective ways. There is an opportunity to acknowledge that one has been playing the wrong game all along - and that the true problem never had anything to do with a lack of prizes, and everything to do with a burning conviction that one might need so many of them. It is a measure of our collective delusion that we are so ready to be proud of high achievers and so slow to detect the wound that powers them on. It would be a less gilded world, but also a far happier one, in which we were readier to reassure the self-hating titans of success that they were worthy of love all along."

    "Title": "Why Little Things Matter During the Apocalypse",
    "Transcript": "There remain few expressions better able to capture the futility of a task than one which compares our efforts to 'rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic.' The hull has been breached, the ship is sinking; to concern ourselves, at such a moment, with the position of the loungers would be the ultimate folly, the deepest possible failure to recognise the true hopelessness of the situation. The point sems grimly apt because we are, many of us, a little like the passengers on a stricken liner. Our larger hopes in life have been fatally holed: we see now that our career won't ever particularly flourish; our relationships will always be compromised; we've passed our peak in terms of looks; our bodies are going to fall prey to ever more humiliating illnesses; society isn't going to cure itself; significant political progress looks deeply improbable. Our ship is going down. It can feel as if trying to improve our condition, let alone find pleasure and distraction would be an insult to the facts. Our instinct is to be as funereal and gloomy as our ultimate end. But there's one crucial element that differentiates our predicament from that of the passengers who lost their lives on the RMS Titanic in the early hours of the 15th of April 1912: time. They had little more than two hours between the moment when they felt the ominous shudder of the impact and the moment when the once-majestic vessel broke apart and sank into the north Atlantic. We're going down too, but far, far more slowly. It's as if the captain had let it be known that the hull had been breached, that there were no lifeboats and that there was zero chance of ever reaching port but had added that it would, for that matter, probably be many decades before we would actually slip beneath the waves. So though we can't be saved, though the end will be grim, we still have options as to how to use our remaining time. We are involved in a catastrophe, but there are better and worse ways of filling the days. In the circumstances, expending thought and effort on 'rearranging the deckchairs' is no longer ridiculous at all, it's an eminently logical step; there could be no higher calling. When our large hopes for ourselves become impossible, we have to grow inventive around lesser, but still real, options for the time that remains. Keeping cheerful and engaged, in spite of everything, becomes a major task. If we were on a very gradually sinking luxury liner in the early 20th century, we might every evening strive to put on a dinner jacket and go and dance the Foxtrot to the music of the string quintet, sing a cheerful song or settle into the Second-class Library on C-Deck - as, all the while, bits of seaweed and debris lapped at our ankles. Or we might look out for the best spot for our collapsible recliner so that we could watch the sea-birds wheeling in the sky or gain some privacy for a long, soul-exploring conversation with a new friend - to the sound of crockery smashing somewhere in a galley down below. We might try our first game of quoits on the slightly tilting deck or drop in - contrary to our habits up to this time - on a wild party in Steerage. Of course our lives would - from a larger perspective - remain a thorough disaster but we might find we were starting to enjoy ourselves. Such inventiveness is precisely what we need to learn to develop to cope with our state. How can we invest the coming period with meaning even though everything is, overall, entirely dark? It's a question our culture hasn't prepared us for. We've been taught to focus on our big hopes, on how we can aim for everything going right. We crave a loving marriage, deeply satisfying and richly rewarding work, a stellar reputation, an ideally fit body and positive social change. We've not been prepared - as yet - to ask ourselves, what remains when many of these are no longer available, when love will always be tricky, politics compromised or the crowd hostile. What are our viable versions of seeking the best spot for a deckchair on a listing liner? If marriage is far less blissful than we'd imagined, perhaps we can turn to friendship; if society won't accord us the dignity we deserve, perhaps we can find a group of fellow outcasts; if our careers have irretrievably faltered, perhaps we can turn to new interests; if political progress turns out to be perennially blocked and the news is always sour, we might absorb ourselves in nature or history. We are turning to what our society might dismiss as Plan-Bs; what you do when you can't do the things you really want to do. But there's a surprising catch - or, really, the opposite of a catch. It may turn out that the secondary, lesser, lighter, reasons for living are, in fact, more substantial than we'd imagined. And once we get to know them, we might come to think that they are what we should have been focused on all along - only it has taken a seeming disaster to get us to realise how central they should always have been."

    "Title": "How To Cope When Mental Illness Shuts Down Our Minds",
    "Transcript": "It may sound odd or impolite to suggest that most of us, when we are in the grip of mental illness, are no longer capable of thinking. That's not how it feels of course. From the inside, our minds have probably never felt so busy and so focused. From the moment we wake up in panic and self-disgust, we are ruminating, pondering, exploring catastrophic scenarios, scanning our past, attacking ourselves for things we have done and not done, questioning our legitimacy, talking to ourselves about how repulsive we are, paying attention to strange voices recommending that we are evil and sick and headed for the worst – and wondering how and whether we should kill ourselves. Our minds don't give us a moment of respite, we may rub our temples to cool them down and when eventually we fall asleep, we are exhausted by the marathons our thoughts have run inside us. Nevertheless, we may still want to insist (for the kindest and most redemptive of reasons) that we have not been thinking at all, that none of this hive of activity deserves the title of thinking; it is just illness. To be mentally ill is to be swamped by secretions of fear, self-hatred and despair that – like surging seawater through a pumping station control desk – knock out all our higher faculties, all our normal ability to sensibly distinguish one thing from another, to find perspective, to weigh arguments judiciously, to see the wood for the trees, to correctly assess danger, to plan realistically for the future, to determine risks and opportunities and, most importantly, to be kind and generous to ourselves. None of these faculties function any longer, but – and this is the true nastiness of the illness – we are never and nowhere alerted to our loss. We are both very ill and very unaware. It looks as though we are continuing to think as we have always done – with all the usual intelligence and reliability – but that we just have a lot more to worry about. Nowhere along the way does our mind generously tell us that it has begun to look at reality through a distorted lens, that it has – at some point in the day – to all effects stopped working. No bell goes off, no hazard lights start to flash. The mind merely insists that it is giving us all the normal readings, and that we have objectively entered hell. Yet the truth is that we have lost command of about a third of our minds and are pulling together our ideas from the most degenerate, traumatised, unreliable and vicious aspects of ourselves. It's as if a group of terrorists had donned white coats and were impersonating prestigious scientists in order to lay out a set of vicious theories and prognoses. Once we have been through a few cycles of distorted thinking and recovered contact with reality, we should do ourselves the kindness of accepting that – on an intermittent basis – we will lose command of our higher faculties and that there is nothing embarrassing in recognising the possibility and accommodating ourselves to it very carefully. This is the nature of an illness around which we will need to take the greatest care. We should start to get better at detecting when illness might be drawing in on us, what the triggers for it might be. Then when it is upon us, we should do and decide nothing. We shouldn't start to send emails, deliver judgement on our lives or plan for the future. We should – as much as possible – stop all mental activity and rest. We might listen to music, have a long bath, watch something untaxing on television and perhaps take a calming pill. We should also try to plug our brain into that of someone else, to benefit from their greater powers of reason. We should have a trusted friend or therapist whom we can call on at such moments and ask them if they might recalibrate and regulate our thoughts with an injection of their wisdom and insight. We should willingly put them in charge of determining how things are for us: they should be allowed to tell us what we are worth, what we have done, what there is to worry about – and we should do our best to discount the contrary, doom-laden signals that come from inside us. We may have grown up with the idea that so long as we are conscious, our minds will be working optimally. But mental illness teaches us a more complicated lesson: our higher faculties (those that give us access to reality) are extremely vulnerable and perilously prone to shut down under the sway of our emotional complexities – and to do so without telling us . We should strive to become thinkers who recognise when they are no longer able to think."

    "Title": "Why you can't find a partner",
    "Transcript": "There is a particular kind of person who is always - it seems - unlucky in love. Despite their best intentions and efforts, they seem to move from one unsatisfying candidate to another without ever being able to settle. One lover turned out to be secretly married to someone else, another - after an initial period of enthusiasm - never called back, a third turned out to be alcoholic and violent… We can only express sympathy for what seems like so much bad luck. And yet, if one examines the problem at closer range, we're liable to find that bad luck can only explain so much - and that there has, in addition, been a process of careful curation at work. The unfortunate lover has not simply stumbled upon a succession of frustrating or mean-minded partners, they have actively sought these out and invited them in, while simultaneously ensuring that no kinder candidate could ever gain a foothold. They still deserve a lot of sympathy, but not for the problem they have ostensibly complained about. It is logical to imagine that what we naturally want in love is someone who will treat us with respect and tenderness, with loyalty and thoughtfulness. But however much these may sound desirable in theory, in reality, such qualities are, in some, liable to provoke huge anxieties and - on occasion - feelings of revulsion. It might seem uncomplicatedly beautiful if someone makes us breakfast in bed, gives us endearing nicknames, tells us how much they miss us, cries a little when we go away on a long trip and offers us a thoughtful-looking teddy bear to pack in our case. There could surely be nothing nicer, except that is, if we are in any way in doubt as to our own value. For the self-hating ones among us, such attentions are likely to trigger acute discomfort and anxiety: why does our lover seem to think so much better of us than we think of ourselves? Why do they hold us in such high esteem when we, for our part, cannot bear our reflection? How have we come to be so heroic in their eyes when we are so despicable in our own? Why do they call us beautiful and kind, intelligent and thoughtful when we feel as if we are none of these things? Their attentions end up having to be met with all the disdain we accord to false flatterers. We are sickened to receive gifts that we are, deep down, sure we do not deserve. It's as an escape from this form of nausea that we may run into the arms of people who can be relied upon to be satisfactorily cruel to us. They aren't delighted when we walk into a room, they have no interest in our childhoods or what happened to us today, they show no particular enthusiasm for sleeping with us, they flirt with others and give us no guarantee that the relationship will survive until tomorrow. It sounds appalling and in a sense it is, but it may feel a lot less appalling than to be showered by a kindness we are certain in our bones that we have never earnt. At least the meanness on display accords perfectly with our assessment of ourselves. Whatever we may claim, there are almost always a host of potential romantic partners ready to treat us very nicely; it is just that - without any awareness of the process - we have probably become experts at dismissing them at the first opportunity, tossing them aside with terms like 'boring' or 'uninspiring' - by which we really mean: uninclined to think as badly of us as we think of ourselves or unlikely to make us suffer in the way we need to suffer in order to feel we are receiving the sort of attention that befits us. In truth, these kind people are generally very far from dull or stupid. They have cleverly spotted something about us that we have not yet taken on board: that we are not appalling and that beneath our defences, we remain kind, sweet and worthy. These observers just frighten us because, with their kindness, they challenge a fundamental pillar of our psychology, the idea that we are owed punishment. We will learn to see many such kind lovers waiting for us in the wings, and will be far readier to let them into our affections, the moment we can accept that, for all our many (yet utterly normal) flaws, we don't deserve to be treated badly for the rest of our lives."

    "Title": "LITERATURE - Oscar Wilde",
    "Transcript": "On Valentine's Day in 1895, the most famous playwright in the English speaking world, Oscar Wilde, presented his new play, The Importance of Being Earnest, in London at St. James Theatre. The audience was packed with celebrities, aristocrats and famous politicians, eagerly awaiting another triumph from a man universally heralded as a genius. At the end of the performance, there was a standing ovation. Critics adored the play and so did audiences, making it Wilde's fourth major success in only three years. Yet, only a few short months later, Wilde was bankrupt and about to be imprisoned. His reputation was in tatters and his life ruined beyond repair. It was, as everyone then and now agreed, a tragedy, the swift fall of a great man due to a small but fateful slip. The story of how Oscar Wilde went from celebrity playwright to prisoner, in such a short space of time, has much to teach us about disgrace and infamy. We don't have to be acclaimed to understand that Wilde's poignant tragedy urges us to abandon our normal moralism and have sympathy for those who stray, it calls for us to extend our love not just to those who obviously deserve it but precisely to those who seem not to. We talk a lot of what a civilised world should be like. We might put it like this: a civilised world would be one in which Oscar Wilde could have been forgiven – and in which those who make errors of judgement could be treated with high degrees of sympathy and, even, of kindness. It would be a world in which we could remember that good people can at times do bad things – and should not pay an eternal price for them. Wilde's tragedy began several years earlier, when he was introduced to a beguiling young man named Lord Alfred Douglas. Douglas, known to family and friends as 'Bosie', was extremely handsome, charming and arrogant. By 1892, a year after they had met, the two men had fallen profoundly in love. Although Wilde was married with two children, he spent much of his time with Bosie: there was a sixteen year age gap, Douglas was twenty-four, Wilde forty. They travelled together, stayed in hotels and hosted large dinners for their friends. By 1894, the pair were constantly seen together in public and rumours of their love affair had spread as far as Bosie's father, the Marquess of Queensbury. The Marquess was a cruel, aggressive character, known for inventing the 'Queensbury Rules' of amateur boxing. Having decided that Wilde was corrupting his son, he demanded that the pair stop seeing each other. When Wilde refused, Queensbury began to hound him across London, threatening violence against restaurant and hotel managers if they allowed Wilde and Bosie onto the premises. Queensbury booked a seat for the opening night of The Importance of Being Earnest. He planned to throw a bouquet of rotting vegetables at Wilde when he took to the stage. When Wilde heard about the stunt, he had him barred from the theatre and Queensbury flew into a rage. He tried to accost Wilde after the performance at the Albemarle Club in Mayfair. When the porters refused to let him in, he left a calling card which publicly accused Wilde of having sex with other men. Since homosexuality was illegal and deeply frowned upon in Victorian society this was a dangerous accusation. Seeing no end to Queensbury's bullying behaviour, Wilde decided to take legal action. By suing Queensbury for libel, Wilde hoped to clear his name and put an end to the harassment. When the trial began, Wilde was confident. He took the stand and gave witty, distracting answers during his cross-examination. Within a few days, however, the tide had turned against him. It became clear that Queensbury's lawyers had hired private detectives to uncover an uncomfortable truth: that both Wilde and Bosie had hired male prostitutes. Some had even blackmailed Wilde in the past, successfully extorting money from him in return for their silence. The trial was hopeless and Wilde withdrew his case, but events had spiralled beyond his control. Queensbury's lawyers forwarded their evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions and Wilde was soon arrested on charges of gross indecency. The legal costs left him bankrupt and theatres were forced to abandon his plays. Wilde's criminal trial began at the Old Bailey on April 26. He faced twenty-five charges, all of which surrounded his sexual relationships with younger men. Wilde continued to deny the allegations and the jury could not reach a verdict, but when the prosecution were allowed to try Wilde a second time he was eventually found guilty. The judge said at his sentencing, “It is the worst case I have ever tried. I shall pass the severest sentence that the law allows. Wilde was sentenced to two years' of hard labour. Inmates in London's Pentonville Prison, where he was sent, spent six hours a day walking on a heavy treadmill or untangling old rope using their hands and knees. For someone of Wilde's luxurious background, it was an impossible hardship. His bed was a hard plank which made it difficult to fall asleep. Prisoners were kept alone in their cells and barred from talking to one another. He suffered from dysentery and became physically very frail. After six months, he was transferred to Reading Gaol. As he stood on the central platform of Clapham Junction, with handcuffs around his wrists, passers-by began to recognise the celebrity playwright. They laughed and mocked. Some even spat at him. 'For half an hour I stood there,' he wrote afterwards, 'in the grey November rain surrounded by a jeering mob. For a year after that was done to me, I wept every day at the same hour and for the same space of time.' During his last year in prison, Wilde wrote an anguished essay, De Profundis: 'I once a lord of language, have no words in which to express my anguish and my shame… Terrible as was what the world did to me, what I did to myself was far more terrible still…. The gods had given me almost everything. But I let myself be lured into long spells of senseless and sensual ease…I allowed pleasure to dominate me. I ended in horrible disgrace. There is only one thing for me now, absolute humility… I have lain in prison for nearly two years… I have passed through every possible mood of suffering… The only people I would care to be with now are artists and people who have suffered: those who know what beauty is, and those who know what sorrow is: nobody else interests me.' In May 1897, Wilde was finally released. He set sail for Dieppe in France the very same day. His wife, Constance, had changed her name and moved abroad with their two sons, Vyvyan (now 11) and Cyril (12). Wilde would never see his children again; he missed them every day. Constance agreed to send him money on the condition that he end his relationship with Bosie, but only a few months later, the pair reunited and the money stopped. They moved to Naples and Wilde began using the name Sebastian Melmoth, inspired by the great Christian martyr Saint Sebastian and a character from a Gothic novel who had sold his soul to the devil. They hoped to find privacy abroad, but the scandal seemed to follow them wherever they went. English patrons recognised them in hotels and demanded they be turned away. After Constance stopped sending money, Bosie's mother offered to pay their debts if he returned home and the pair once again parted ways; it proved equally impossible. Scorned by many of his former friends, Wilde moved to Paris where he lived in relative poverty. He spent most of his time and money in bars and cafes, borrowing money whenever he could and drinking heavily. His weight ballooned and his conversation dragged. He was slowly inebriating himself to death. When a friend suggested he try to write another comic play, he replied: “I have lost the mainspring of life and art […] I have pleasures, and passions, but the joy of life is gone.” His final piece of writing, a poem, The Ballad of Reading Gaol, was published in 1898. The author's name was listed as 'C.3.3.' – Wilde's cell block and cell number from his time in the prison. Towards the end of 1900, Wilde developed meningitis and became gravely ill. A Catholic priest visited his hotel and baptised him into the church. He died the following day at the age of 46. More than a century later, in 2017, a law was passed to exonerate those who had been convicted due to their sexuality and Oscar Wilde received an official pardon from the UK government. 'It is hugely important,' declared a government minister, 'that we pardon people convicted of historical sexual offences who would be innocent of any crime today.' Our society has become generous towards Wilde's specific behaviour – but it remains moralistic towards a huge number of other peoples and ways of life Many of us would – across the ages – want to comfort and befriend Oscar Wilde. It's a touching hope, but one that would be best employed in extending understanding to all those less talented and less witty figures who are right now facing grave difficulties and still, deserve compassion.  That would be true civilisation and a world in which Wilde's horrifying downfall had not been in vain.

    "Title": "The Unique Power Of Gardening in Islamic Culture",
    "Transcript": "The idea of a garden has always been central to Islam for reasons that are at once hopeful, because nature is so beautiful, and deeply melancholy because life itself can never be made perfect. For Islam, the world we inhabit will always be mired in khaṭīʾa or sin. No human enterprise or institution can ever be without significant degrees of dhanb or wrong-doing: jealousy, stubbornness, rage and lack of forgiveness predominate. Only in the next life can we hope to escape the irritation and the agony; only in jannah or paradise, will we be assured of true contentment. In paradise, to listen to the Quran, there be flowing rivers, flowers, incorruptible waters and unchangeable milk, golden goblets, 'virgin companions of equal age' and rows of cushions set out in the balmy shade of fruit trees. Yet because this might all be a long way off, Islam recommends an unusual technique to prevent us from losing our poise and despairing: we should become bustani or gardeners. The enlightened should redirect their frustrations with the state of humanity towards the construction of a hadiqa or garden which can, within its limited circumference, with due modesty, be endowed with many of the qualities of the eventual garden of paradise. Our garden should have flowing water, some reflecting pools, symmetrical flower beds, fruit trees and places to sit. Everywhere where Muslim civilisation spread, gardens developed along with it and in the drier regions, where nothing would grow, flowers and trees were represented on carpets, which functioned as miniature mobile gardens that could be carried on the back of a camel. When the Muslims reached Southern Spain, the climate allowed them to create pieces of horticulture which astonish and seduce us to this day. A telling observation about gardening is that almost everyone over the age of sixty-five is concerned with it, and almost no one in their late teens has ever evinced the slightest interest in it. The difference isn't coincidental. A person's enthusiasm for gardening is inversely correlated to their degrees of hope for life in general. The more one believes that the whole of existence can be rendered perfect, that love and marriage can be idyllic, that our careers can reward us materially and honour us creatively, the less time we will have for beds of laurel or thyme, lavender or rosemary. Why would we let such minor interventions detain us when far greater perfection is within reach? But a few decades on, most of our dreams are liable to have taken a substantial hit, much of what we put our faith in professionally and romantically will have failed, at which point we might be ready to look with different, and significantly more sympathetic eyes, at the consolations offered by cyprus trees and myrtle hedges, geraniums and lilies of the valley. No longer will gardening be a petty distraction from a mighty destiny, rather a shelter from gusts and squalls of despair. Islam is appropriately wise in its ambitions. It doesn't tell its followers to plough themselves a farm, nor does it advise them to focus on a window box. The scale is carefully calibrated: neither too big to mire us in unmanageable expense and bureaucracy nor too small to humiliate and sadden us. The garden becomes a perfect home for our remaining pleasures in a troubled world; it's where we can repair to contemplate islands of beauty once we have come to know and sorrowfully navigated oceans of pain."

    "Title": "Acceptance and Mental Health",
    "Transcript": "One of the great contributing factors to mental illness is the idea that we should at all costs and at all times be well. We suffer far more than we should because of how long it can take many of us until we allow ourselves to fall properly and usefully ill. In a crisis, our chances of getting better rely to a significant extent on having the right relationship to our illness; an attitude which is relatively unfrightened by our distress, which isn't overly in love with the idea of seeming at all times 'normal', which can allow us to be deranged for a while in order one day to reach a more authentic kind of sanity. It will help us immensely in this quest if the images of mental illness we can draw on at this time do not narrowly imply that our ailment is merely a freakish and pitiable possibility, if we can appeal to images that tease out the universal and dignified themes of our state, so that we do not - on top of everything else - have to fear and hate ourselves for being unwell. We stand to heal a great deal faster if there are fewer associations like those created by Goya (of madness as the seventh circle of hell) and more of men and women a little like you and me, sitting on the sofa, able to combine our inner wretchedness with other, more temperate and attractive qualities - so that we remain every bit human, despite our terrifying convulsions, absences of mind, catastrophic forebodings and sense of despair. The best philosophical background against which to wrestle with mental unwellness would be one that conceived of the human animal as intrinsically rather than accidentally flawed, a philosophy that would resolutely reject the notion that we could ever be perfect and would instead welcome our griefs and our errors, our stumbles and our follies as no less a part of us than our triumphs and our intelligence. It is Japan's Zen Buddhism that has historically perhaps best put forward such notions, with its bold declaration that life itself is suffering, and its veneration in the visual arts - and by extension in its psychology - of what is imperfect and un-glossy: rainy autumn evenings, sadness, moss covered roofs, stained wooden panels, tears and, most famously, misshapen and irregular pieces of pottery. Against such a background, it becomes a great deal easier for us to accept ourselves in our unwell state. We feel less guilty that we are not at work and are not playing up to the roles demanded of us by responsible others. We can be less defensive and frightened, more inclined to seek out proper care - and more likely to recover properly in time. With a philosophy of acceptance in mind, we can recognise that whatever the particularities of our crisis (which will naturally need to be investigated in due course), our pains fit into a broad picture of a crisis-prone human condition. No one is spared. No life can escape significant troubles. Everything is imperfect. We don't have to know the details of someone's life to be able to guess at the scale of the difficulties they too will have encountered. We have all been born to inadequate parents, our desires will always exceed reality, we will all make some appalling errors, we will hurt those we love and anger those with power over us, we will be anxious and confused, woeful and lost. We should accept both that we are profoundly unwell - and that our ailments are entirely normal. Japanese philosophy has another lesson for us at this point: we will probably one day be fixed but there are likely to be substantial and ineradicable marks. And yet, these marks can be worn with pride and self-respect. According to Zen Buddhism's tradition of kintsugi, an accidentally smashed bowl isn't to be thrown away in embarrassment, its pieces can be carefully collected and reassembled with glue inflected with gold. The traces of repair are made obvious, celebrated and cherished, as if to suggest to us - as we bring a cup to our lips - that we do not have to give up on ourselves or be ashamed of our own brokenness. We can confront our illness without panic or fear, with a quiet intelligent sadness perhaps best captured by the word melancholy. If we were searching for a patron saint of such a melancholy relationship to mental difficulty, we could do worse than pick the Welsh artist Gwen John, who combined a brilliant career as a painter with moments of harrowing mental collapse - but remained all the while fundamentally on the side of life. From her self-portrait, John implies that she would understand whatever we might be going through, her eyes hint that she has been there too, that she could be our guide to the underworld of our minds - and that, however much we might hate ourselves at this moment, we deserve gentleness, patience and respect as we feel our way towards repair."

    "Title": "How You Could Ruin Someone's Day or Life",
    "Transcript": "A lot of evil is done in the world by people who can't imagine that they have any power to hurt anyone. It's their sense that nothing is at stake in their behaviour towards others that leads them to ignore the rules of politeness and humanity - and to kick people as if they were plated in armour. They are - in this respect - paying homage to childhood. Think of the situation of a young child, of perhaps six, who has fun mocking a parent's double chin or the wrinkles around their eyes. To this child, the parent is still, in many ways, an invulnerable deity. They live in a remote, impressive world of work, credit cards, driving and the news. How could someone of such stature be hurt by a comment about their less than perfect physique by a tiny person who can't spell properly? But the child is missing the point. Their words do hurt. They can make their parents cry (in private). The child simply can't grasp how desperate and anxious their parent might be, how every morning they might stare in dismay into the bathroom mirror at the visible signs of ageing that speak to them relentlessly of a wrongly lived-life. The parent, out of dignified generosity, has shielded their child from their own fragility. And now their child is paying them a beautiful if misguided, compliment: a belief that they are beyond suffering. Something related may happen when employees get together to gossip about the person they work for. In their imagination, the boss is so far above them that it couldn't possibly matter what they say about them. It's only when they themselves move to senior positions that they start to realise how vulnerable the person in charge might feel, how completely normal it is to want to be liked (even if you have a seat on the board) and how imperfect your self-esteem might be. This idea casts a useful light on the activity of particularly dangerous people online. Their venom isn't the expression of a feeling of power. Rather, the troll tends to feel like a medieval vagabond outside a heavily fortified city, hurling insults and threats at what they take to be comfortable inhabitants sleeping behind meters of stone walls lined by vigilant troops. They want to hurt, but they don't in any way actually imagine they can; that is what renders them quite so vicious. True kindness may require us to take on board a very unfamiliar idea: however young we are, however forgotten and ignored we feel we are, we have a power to cause other people serious damage. It isn't because we aren't wealthy or revered in elite circles that we thereby lose a capacity either to comfort or to wound strangers. We become properly moral, and properly adult, when we understand that we may all, whoever we may be, ruin someone's day, and on occasion, through a few incautious and misplaced words, their life."

    "Title": "How To Be More Loving",
    "Transcript": "Perhaps the finest way to develop a loving attitude towards other people is to recall, in the face of their difficulty, that we are, in the end, all children. The claim is an odd one. Adults are clearly not children. They have powers of reasoning that quite outstrip those of younger people, they have options and a sound grasp of right and wrong, they are capable of causing serious damage; they should know better. Children, on the other hand, are well-known for their powers to melt our hearts. Partly this has to do with their physical appearance: with their unusually large eyes, their full cheeks, their unthreatening statures, their tiny fat fleshy fingers. But ultimately, the child attracts our tenderness because, when they act in 'bad' or tricky ways, it tends to be easy to work out why they have done so: they hit their little sister because they were feeling left out; they started to steal things from the other children because their parents were going through a divorce; they ran away from the party without saying goodbye because they were panicked by a sense of unworthiness. Overall, when it comes to the psychology of children, we discover a surprising and hugely gentle truth: that 'badness' and difficulty are, invariably, the result of some form of pain, discomfort, hurt or wound. The child does not start by being dreadful, they become so in response to injury, fear or sorrow. With adults on the other hand, confronted by nasty or terrible behaviour, our thoughts do not - for understandable reasons - generally turn to imagining why it might have occurred. We're satisfied with nimble and compressed reasons: because they're an arsehole, because they're crazy. This will do for now. And yet it is always open to us to wonder why someone acted as they did - and here we are liable to stumble on an always provocative and properly revolutionary idea: the reason why little children and big people do wrong is - despite the differences in age and size - exactly the same. One category may be no bigger than a chair, the other can be gigantic and able to carry guns, post lengthy screeds online or start and bankrupt companies, but in the end, the psychology of blunder, meanness and anger is always the same: evil is a consequence of injury. The big person did not start off evil, their difficult sides were not hard wired from the start, they grew towards malice on account of some form of wound waiting to be discovered. It is work of extraordinary patience and humanity - it is the work of love - to go in search of what these wounds might be. To search is morally frightening because we too easily imagine that it might require us to wind up thinking well of behaviour we know is abhorrent: it doesn't at all, we can remain appalled while simultaneously tracing a path back to the true catalytic factors. The work can also be practically frightening because we imagine that it might require us to leave someone at liberty to cause us or others yet more pain: but again, we can keep the wrong doer safely behind very high bars, even as we sensitively explore the origins of their violations. Once the full stories of our trespassers become known, our perspective may swiftly rework itself. The bully who pursued us online had once worked as a porter, then been fired some years back and fallen into depression and was facing the bankruptcy courts. The angry populist politician was remorselessly belittled by a powerful father. The sexually impulsive person used their addiction to calm themselves down from some unmasterable anxieties related to early emotional neglect. Our judgement on behaviour never has to change; our sense of why it occurred can be transformed. The discipline of psychotherapy has been central in helping us to chart the sometimes unobvious or contrary connections between a symptom and its genesis. Boastfulness may have its roots in fear; anger can mask terror; hatred can be a defence against love. The haughty air of the grown up can take hold as a way of compensating for invisibility. A satirical manner can be a shield against an exiled longing for sweetness. THe prison system in most countries tends to place people below the age of eighteen in separate young offenders' institutions, which treat inmates with a degree of kindness and hope - in order to delve into the psychology of transgression with a view to understanding and overcoming its causes. But after this age, for the most part, prisoners are locked up in bare cells and the key is - metaphorically - thrown away. They should, after all, have known better. And yet we are all, as it were, young offenders, however old we might actually be; in other words, we all need our crimes to be treated with a degree of sympathy and empathetic investigation. It is an exquisite feat of mind to be able to imagine them as always still, at some level, infants in a cradle."

    "Title": "How Perfectionism Makes Us Ill",
    "Transcript": "There is a kind of person who seems - at first glance - to benefit from an admirable degree of self-motivation, thoroughness and drive. They are up at dawn, they rarely take holidays, they are always sneaking in an extra hour or two of work. Their bosses are highly impressed, they are constantly promoted, their grades have been excellent since primary school, they never miss an appointment or turn in a piece of work that is less than stellar. We like to say that such a person has high standards; we might even anoint them with the term 'perfectionist.' It might seem churlish to locate any problems here. Why complain about a somewhat overzealous devotion to perfection in a troubled and lackadaisical world? There could surely be nothing too awful about high exactitude? What could be so imperfect about perfectionism? The concern is not so much with the work of the perfectionist (its recipients are in a privileged position) as with the state of their soul. Perfectionism does not - tragically - spring first and foremost from any kind of love of perfection in and of itself. It has its origins in a far more regrettable feeling of never being good enough. It is rooted in self-hatred - sparked by memories of being disapproved of or neglected by those who should more fairly have esteemed us warmly in childhood. We become perfectionists from a primary sense of being unworthy; uninteresting, flawed, a disappointment, a letdown, a nuisance. So powerful is this sense, so appalling is it in its pressure on our psyches, we are prepared to do more or less anything to expunge it: working at all hours, currying favour with authority, doing twice as much as the next person, these are the tools with which we seek to cleanse our apparently shamefully undeserving selves. One part of the mind promises the other that the completion of the next challenge will finally usher in peace. We can be very good at pretending that our ambitions are sane. But our work has a sisyphean dimension. No sooner have we rolled our working boulder up the hill than it will tumble back down again. There is never going to be a point of rest or a lasting feeling of completion. We are - in truth - ill rather than driven. We aren't interested in perfect work at all: we are trying to escape from a feeling of being awful people - and work simply happens to be the medium through which we are striving to grow tolerable in our own eyes. But because our problem didn't begin with work, nor can work ever prove the solution. Our real goal is not, as we think, to be an ideal employee or professional, it is to feel acceptable. But responsibility for a sense of acceptance cannot be handed over to our bosses or customers or a ceaselessly demanding capitalist system; these will never let us rest easy because it is in their nature, without any evil intent, always to demand more. We need to shift our sense of where our drive is coming from. We are not unnaturally interested in working perfectly, we are labouring under an unusually intense impression that we are dreadful people - a problem for which working harder cannot be the answer. We need to allow ourselves to imagine that we deserved to be accepted from the start and that it cannot forever be our fault in our minds that we were not. It is not up to us to try to prove that we have a right to exist. It is asking too much of ourselves to have to experience a referendum on our legitimacy every time we hand in a report, every exam we have to pass, every customer we have to serve. Working well is - naturally - an admirable goal. But it becomes a symptom of a mental perturbation when it becomes the cover for a secret aspiration to correct a deficit of early love. We should welcome an ability to tolerate periods of laziness, not because we are congenitally idle - but because it is a sign that we have learnt to speak more kindly to ourselves and to be appropriately angry with those who could not at the outset accept us for who we were without a surfeit of trophies and prizes."

    "Title": "A Self-hatred Questionnaire",
    "Transcript": "One of the odder features of self-hatred is that the affliction may escape our notice for the greater part of our lives. We may simply not be aware that we don't like ourselves very much - even as the sickness of self-hatred wreaks its havoc across a range of psychological situations and opportunities. Though we are relentless scrutinisers of others, we seldom pause to give a unitary verdict on what we make of our own characters. We may recognise our approval or distaste of ourselves in relation to specific actions; we will know when we are - for example - cross about being slow to complete a task or when we are pleased to have won a colleague's approval but we are on the whole uninclined to step far back and consider ourselves in totality, as we might a stranger. We are too involved with ourselves on an ongoing basis to assess the sharper outlines of our own characters. There are few occasions when we are summoned to ask whether we essentially like the person we are. As a result, our self-suspicion tends to linger in undiagnosed forms. We miss the extent to which we can suffer from endemic self-loathing - and how a once acceptable and perhaps invigorating form of self-questioning has turned into a lacerating sequence of attacks on everything we are and do. We may - paradoxically - be at once highly depressed about ourselves - and oblivious that we are so. In order to know what we are up against, we should take a measure of our sense of self. For this, there may be no better move than to resort to that clumsiest but simple and most helpful of psychological tools, the questionnaire. We can ask to what extent we might agree with the following sentences on a scale of one to ten, ten meaning very much, zero indicating not at all. - If people knew who I really was, they would be horrified. - The inside of me is appalling. - Often, I can't bear who I am. - I'm disgusting. - I'm shameful - I'm weak - Others have a good cause to hate and harm me - It's only a matter of time before terrible things happen to me, given who I am. - I'm sexually revolting - I am physically repulsive - I am unworthy of being forgiven - I am a fitting target for ridicule - I am bound to fail - I don't deserve much sympathy - People often see me in the street and feel contempt. - I have acted badly across my whole life - There is something fundamentally wrong with me. We don't need to do careful sums to arrive at an indicative picture at speed. Some of us will be reaching for tens on pretty much every occasion; others - blessedly - will be puzzled by the whole exercise. This book is not for them. If we find ourselves reaching for high numbers, we may be tempted to come to a powerful yet entirely mistaken conclusion: that we are terrible people. The reality is at once less personally damning and far more redemptive: we aren't so terrible at all, we are just very ill. The questionnaire is telling us about an affliction, not about our past or what we deserve or who we really are. The very extremity of our answers should signal that something is afoot that far exceeds what any human is ever owed. We aren't intolerably wicked; we are in the grip of a cruel sickness which systematically destroys any confidence or generosity we might feel towards ourselves. We are treating ourselves with a violence and pitilessness we wouldn't think of bestowing upon our worst enemies. We have, somehow, unbeknownst to us, ended up considering the person we have to accompany through life with an unparalleled degree of coldness and disdain. It is time to come to terms with our suffering - and to refuse the delusion and meanness of self-hatred."

    "Title": "Learning to Forgive Ourselves",
    "Transcript": "Our refusal to forgive ourselves for our mistakes tends to hang on a strong sense of how much these were, in the end, avoidable. We obsessively go back over our slips and errors and contrast what did happen with what could so easily have been skirted if we had not been so fatuous and so witless. We experience recurring jabs of pain at the disjuncture between the agonising present and it's now-vanished alternative: we should never have written that email, we should never have become involved with that person, we should have listened more closely to the advice, we should never have borrowed the money… longside the pain come questions: why didn't we have greater foresight? Why couldn't we muster more self-restraint? How could we have been so indiscreet? From this close up, there are no realistic, let alone kind, ways to answer our punitive self-interrogations; and they are, as a result, likely to go on forever, without let up in agony. We will at best conclude that we messed up because we were greedy, because we were vain, shallow, intemperate and weak-willed; that we have ruined our lives because we are lustful, harebrained, immature and egocentric. Our self-hatred will grow ever more intense as we contrast our soiled lives with the impeccable choices of others. They - the reasonable and good ones, the calm and happy ones - had it right all along: they didn't succumb to temptations, they stayed steady and dutiful, they kept their priorities straight and paid due respect to public opinion. The overall conclusion is that we are ultimately simply awful people - who should probably (depending on the severity of the problem we are in) kill ourselves forthwith. If we are to avoid eternal self-loathing or suicide, we will have to find another approach. We cannot forever explain our mistakes by examining this or that local flaw in our characters. We need to lean on a far more holistic and objective answer. We messed up because we are human - which in this context means that we belong to a species that is compelled by its very nature to steer through life without the knowledge and experience required to ensure goodness and wisdom, kindness and happiness. We may regret this or that error, but from the right distance, we are fundamentally steering blind and are therefore doomed to slip up with greater or lesser severity at some point or other. We can't know exactly who we should marry. We don't have foolproof knowledge of where our real talents lie, let alone how the economy will perform, and therefore can't determine the sort of career we should optimally invest ourselves in. We may make a reasonable guess at what activities and situations might be dangerous but we cannot know ahead of time exactly where the true risks lie; there are landmines buried everywhere. Assumptions made in one era may fail to be correct in another. We can be caught out by swift changes in mores: what could have been acceptable at one point can turn into an indecency a few years later. Certainly we may have experienced a particularly jagged edge of life which has destroyed us in a very specific way. But though the wound is local, injury is almost endemic. It could have been foretold from the start that something rather bad would at some moment happen to us, not because there is anything especially deficient about us, but because human brains are lacking the necessary matter to lead us faultlessly through the decades-long obstacle course of life. That said, our self-contempt tends to be heightened because we refuse to think about luck. We look at where we have ended up and compare it with the more fortunate places of others and come to only one verdict: we must have been more stupid than they are, our characters must have been more corrupt than theirs. But in the process, we miss out on a critical explanatory factor: whatever our flaws may have been, we may have had to contend with a particularly vicious swerve of fate. There have been people every bit as hasty or unreasonable as us who (for now) have sailed on unmolested. Events have pressed more harshly on the vulnerable parts of our personalities. Anyone who would have been tested as we were would have failed in comparable ways. In assessing our destiny, we should remember to claim a very large role for the forces of foul luck. At the same time, we do ourselves an injury by comparing ourselves only with those above us, rather than considering our state in the round. In our abject moods, we look enviously at those who are presently riding high while failing to consider the hundreds, even millions, of those who have endured destinies ever bit as cruel as our own. The human condition has seldom been a smiling one: we should not compound our difficulties by refusing to consider all those who have wept every bit as much, and lost even more than us. Nor should we keep equating ourselves with people who, while they might have some superficial similarities with ourselves in terms of age or educational background, in the end had incomparably different psychological beginnings. They didn't have our mother or our father, they didn't have to go through what we did, they didn't have to master our emotional immaturities. They may seem to be our equals but they in fact belong to a more blessed cohort. We should nurture sympathy for ourselves based on a fine grained appreciation of the specific burdens we had to take on. A degree of regret may sometimes be helpful: it can help us to take stock of errors and to avoid the worst of the pitfalls next time. But runaway self-hatred serves no useful purpose whatsoever; it is in its masochistic way an indulgence we can't afford. We may be foolish, but this doesn't single us out as particularly awful or unusual, it only confirms that we belong to the human race, a fact for which we deserve limitless sympathy and compassion."

    "Title": "Can Pills or Therapy Save You?",
    "Transcript": "For most of the history of humanity, there was nothing at all one could swallow when one was mentally ill. The full force of one's sickness had to run unchecked. Then, in 1950, Paul Charpentier, a French chemist working at Laboratoires Rhône-Poulenc, succeeded in synthesising a drug called 4560RP, later renamed chlorpromazine. When rats were injected with it, placed in a crowded cage and convulsed with electric shocks, they showed none of the expected alarm and frenzy, settling instead into a serene and indifferent mood. When given to humans, the drug had a similar calming effect: American soldiers in the Korean war were able to walk into the battlefield with total fearlessness. In hospitals, psychotic patients who were placed on the drug became sociable, unaggressive and ready to rejoin ordinary life. The world's first antipsychotic drug was born. It would over the coming decades be followed by dozens more seemingly miraculous medicines, all of them playing - in ways that their creators did not and still do not entirely understand - with the brain's receptors for dopamine, the hormone held to be responsible for excessive excitement and fear. Alongside these antipsychotics, there emerged a family of antidepressants, in particular those known as SSRIs, that could increase the brain's levels of serotonin, the neurotransmitter and hormone associated with uplift, motivation and positive moods. The drugs were baptised with names that put language to ever more daunting uses: fluoxetine, citalopram, paroxetine, escitalopram, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole. Whatever the particularities of each example, modern psychiatry ended up operating with two essential instruments: pills that could calm us down (reducing terror, paranoia, mania, disinhibition, insomnia and aggression) and pills that could lift us up (alleviating despair, moroseness and loss of meaning). Thanks to these medicines, occupancy rates of psychiatric hospitals plummeted, decreasing by some 80% in developed countries between 1955 and 1990. Illnesses that had been a near-death sentence a generation before could now be managed by swallowing one or two pills a day. It looked as if our unruly minds had finally been tamed. But the answer was not complete. All these medicines turned out to have serious physical side effects (being intermittently responsible for dramatic weight gain, diabetes, kidney malfunction and blood clots). Yet the charge against them at a psychological level was more fundamental: that they did not and could never - on the basis of their approach - get to grips with the true causes of mental illness. At best, they could control appalling symptoms while being unable to grapple with what, in the individual past, had led to them in the first place. To be fair to psychiatry, even if this were true, it is no mean feat to be able to offer a person a measure of control over their mental symptoms, given the horrors that these can entail. Those of us who have known mental illness from close up would - at the height of our suffering - generally choose to be physically tortured rather than endure yet more of the abominations our minds can inflict. There are varieties of mental unwellness in which we are taken over by anxiety and foreboding - and paralysed by a sense that every minute is carrying us closer to an immense and unnameable catastrophe. We can no longer eat or speak, we may just have to lie in a ball crying, scratching ourselves and waiting for the axe to fall. There are states in which we wake up every morning with a conviction that we need to take an overdose in order to put to an end to the turmoil in our minds. There can be voices inside us that do not for one moment cease telling us that we are guilty, shameful and abhorrent beings. We may live in terror that we are about to lose control or might already have done so. Our imaginations can be haunted by images of stabbing a child or tearing off our own fingernails. It can feel as if there is a monster inside us urging us to do appalling deeds and filling our consciousness with lacerating persecutory thoughts. We may feel our inner coherence dissolving and giving way to a maelstrom of aggression and paranoia. We may be so mysteriously sad that no pleasantry or act of kindness can distract us and all we wish to do is stare mutely out of the window and hope to be gone soon. With the right pills to hand however, some of these nightmares can end. We may know our anxiety is still there but we are granted some distance from it, we are able to stare at it as if it were an enraged tiger in a zoo on the other side of a thick pane of glass. We may not lose sight of our despair and self-loathing but we can acquire an attitude of detachment in relation to it; it doesn't matter quite so much that we are entirely awful and should be put down. We can park the idea for a morning in order to do some work or clean the house. We can put off thoughts of suicide until tomorrow. We don't need to have a complete reckoning with our sadistic ideas at every moment. The crushing sadness can partially lift and we might have the energy for a conversation with a friend or a walk in the park. Only someone who hadn't endured vicious mental suffering would dare to casually dismiss such psychiatric interventions as a plaster over a wound. Nevertheless, most mental illness has a psychological history - and its hold on us will for the most part only properly weaken the more episodes of this painful history we can start to feel and make sense of. Pills may be able to change the background atmosphere of our minds, but our thoughts about ourselves need to be challenged and adjusted with conscious instruments if we are to be able to grow truly well. The genuine resolution of mental disturbance lies in our ability to think - especially of our early childhoods and the key figures and events within it. The unfortunate paradox is that illnesses of the mind generally effect precisely the instrument that we require in order to interpret our lives. It is our conscious reason that is both sick and desperately needed in order to do battle with despair and fear; it is the reason that we need in order to locate persuasive grounds to keep living. This is where pills may usefully join up with psychotherapy to deliver a coherent solution. We might say that the supreme role of pills is to hold back panic and sadness just long enough that we can start to identify why we might want to continue living; they aren't in themselves the cure, but they are at points the essential tools that can make therapy, and through it authentic healing, possible. They promise our minds the rest and safety they require to harness their own strengths."

    "Title": "Two Reasons People End up Bad Parents",
    "Transcript": "Given how important it is to be properly loved by one's parents in order to have an emotionally sane grown-up life, one may wonder with some urgency why - in cases that range from the regrettable to the truly tragic - the process can go so wrong. Why do some parents - who might in other areas be decent and thoughtful characters - fail so badly at being able to love the small people they have brought into the world? Among the many possibilities, two stand out in particular. The first stems from one of the most obvious and unavoidable features of early childhood: an infant arrives on earth in an entirely and almost shockingly vulnerable state. It cannot move its own head, it is utterly reliant on others, it has no understanding of any of its organs, it is in a penumbra of chaos and mystery. In such helpless circumstances, it must look up to others and beseech them for their mercy: it must ask them to bring it nourishment, to stroke its head, to bathe its limbs, to comfort it after a feed, to make sense of its fury and sadness. To most people, all this is just extremely sweet. But in order to take care of a very small person, an adult is forced to undertake a very particular kind of emotional manoeuvre, one which happens so intuitively and speedily in most of us, we tend not even to notice it unfolding: we are required to access our own memories of ourselves at whatever age our young and tender child happens to be, in order that we can then more precisely deliver to it the care and attention it needs. Most adults have no problem connecting with the child version of ourselves. But this ability is far from natural or spontaneous: it is a function of health and a consequence of a degree of emotional privilege. For a more disadvantaged sort of parent however, unbeknownst to themselves, the task of care-via-identification is overwhelmingly challenging. Somewhere in themselves, a wall has been built, many metres thick and topped with razor wire, between their adult and child selves. Something in their childhoods was so difficult, they do not - and cannot - return there imaginatively. Perhaps there was a parent who died, or who touched them in a way they shouldn't or who left them bereft and humiliated. Things in their childhoods were uncomfortable to such an extent that their whole adult identities have been founded on a thorough refusal ever to re-encounter the helplessness and vulnerability of their early years. They won't be able to be patient with the little person's clumsiness and confusion, they will have no interest in playing with teddies, they will think it pathetic how tearful their child has become because a four leaf clover got crumpled or a favourite book has a tear in it. They may - despite themselves - end up saying 'Don't be so silly' or even 'Stop being so childish'. There can follow a second characteristic and associated failing in a parent: unresolved envy. However peculiar it can sound, a parent may envy its own child for the possibility that it might have a better childhood than they had - and will unconsciously ensure it won't. Though ostensibly committed to the care of the child, the parent will struggle against an impulse to inflict against it some of the very same obstacles they faced: the same neglect, the same uncaring school, the same lack of help with their development… The outward details may have changed, but the emotional impact will be the same. A new generation will suffer afresh. In order to parent properly, not only do we need to access our memories of our own childhoods, we need to be able to come to terms with our deprivations so as not to feel jealous of those who might have a chance not to endure comparable ones in turn. But a certain kind of traumatised parent remains at some level identified in their minds as a needy, disappointed child who would find it unbearable that another child had more than they did. They are like a tormented and tormenting sibling in a disadvantaged household who takes out their pain on someone more helpless, scrupulously making sure that the other child is as sad and lacking as they are. We cannot help having had the childhoods we had. But if we are planning to have a child we have a supreme responsibility to ensure that we have a sane relationship to our own pasts: able to access them for reserves of tenderness and empathy, and able not to feel envious of those who do not have to partake in their sufferings. We will be properly grown up when we are in a position to give our offspring the childhood we deserved, not the childhood we had."

Perfection was never on the cards. You're allowed to cry uncontrollably sometimes. Some people will love you always - whatever. Those that matter don't mind; those that mind don't matter. You could always go and live on an island somewhere far away - truly. You have enough time to give this many more goes. Every good life is a mess - in parts. 3 a.m. alone in bed is not the optimal moment at which to derive a true picture of reality. Wait - always - for the perspective of dawn. The only people we can think of as without regrets are those we don't yet know very well. Going a bit mad for a time is a very common and ultimately very sane rite of passage.

    "Title": "ART/ARCHITECTURE - Rembrandt",
    "Transcript": "Born in 1606, Rembrandt became a hugely successful painter when he was still only in his twenties. He earned a fortune and lived a wildly extravagant life. Rembrandt van Rijn - Self-portrait with Saskia But by his early fifties, he was all but bankrupt: he had to sell his house and all the beautiful objects he had accumulated. In the world of respectable, prudent Dutch merchants, his economic ruin was regarded as deeply shameful - and, self-evidently, it was entirely his own fault. Rembrandt, Self-portrait, aged 51, circa 1657 (National gallery of Scotland) Around the time financial disaster struck, Rembrandt painted a self-portrait, burdened with an honest, deeply sorrowful awareness of his own idiocy and folly: it is evident in his eyes that he knows he doesn't deserve anyone's sympathy. Fittingly, given what he had gone through, his culminating masterpiece, painted at the very end of his life relates to another, more famous character who has behaved in a clearly appalling way. Rembrandt, The Return of the prodigal Son, 1669 The picture illustrates a parable from the New Testament known as The Prodigal Son. The kneeling man has been prodigal - in the sense of profligate; he took his father's money, ran away and spent it all on wine, women and song. The prodigal son stands in for Rembrandt himself - the waster who has brought ruin and disgrace upon himself. The son deserves to be hounded and humiliated. But this is not the reception he gets. In the painting, the elderly father-figure greets his son with great compassion and gentleness. Instead of giving his son the stern condemnation that he deserves, the father provides the love, warmth and forgiveness the son needs. The picture conveys Rembrandt's moving and very intimate realisation about the true nature of love: it reaches out to the selfish idiot, to the wastrel, to the passion-driven fool. Love properly understood is destined also for the undeserving. Perhaps Rembrandt's most moving work is a modest looking print entitled Christ Preaching. Significantly, it isn't set in Galilee or Jerusalem in the 1st century AD. Instead the message of kindness is being preached in a back street of a Dutch town, in other words, to Rembrandt's contemporaries. The message can be boiled down to three words: 'I love you' and it's being beamed out to precisely the kinds of people who - in Rembrandt's day - were viewed (with some justification) as particularly odious: they are, we can guess, thieves, layabouts, drunks, pimps and people who lent money at terrifying rates of interest; mean employers and con-artists. If Rembrandt were creating this work today, we might see - ranged around the alleyway - the representative unloveable figures of our times: a politician who incites conflict, the owner of a newspaper that puts profit above truth; someone who is proud of their vulgarity; a snobbish socialite, an arms trader, a feral youth, a sexual deviant or the kind of person who seems to take satisfaction in distressing others. It is to them that the message of love is being directed. Rembrandt's key insight is that everyone needs love - whether they deserve it or not. If we wait to be kind only to those who deserve kindness, we will be waiting for a very long time; in fact, we'll have turned into monsters."

    "Title": "Why We Call Our Partners 'baby'",
    "Transcript": "One of the most striking features of relationships is that, after a while, if things are going well, one or both partners will almost naturally start to refer to the other as 'baby'. They might, alternatively or in addition, stick a diminutive on to the end of their name ('-ie'), buy them a teddy (or show them their own from way back) and late at night speak to them in an unusually high pitched, soothing and sing-songy way. We all invest a considerable part of our energy and our pride in growing up, in ensuring that we no longer need help in tying up our shoelaces, don't need to be reminded to wrap up warm on cold days and can take care of combing our own hair. In short, we try very hard to be adults. But successful grown up relationships demand something rather peculiar of us: while we are rewarded for the overall maturity of our characters and way of life, we are also invited - when striving properly to be close to someone - to access the less developed, and more puerile sides of us. It belongs to authentic adulthood to be able, at points in an intimate relationship, to curl up like a small child and seek to be 'babied' as one might have been many decades before, when we wore pyjamas with elephant prints on them and had a lisp and a small gap in our front teeth. It belongs to health, rather than pathology, to realise how much one might at difficult moments want to be 'mummied' or 'daddied' by a partner and to connect for a time with the helpless, frightened, dependent child one once was and at some level always remain. Sadly though, this selective regression is no easy or charming journey back for those whose childhood involved them in scenes of petrifying suffering and humiliation. For them, growing up has involved a superhuman effort never again to place themselves at the mercy of those who might take advantage of their vulnerabilities. Returning into imaginative contact with 'mummies' and 'daddies' therefore holds no particular charm; their teddies will not be having a picnic any time soon. These bulletproof characters are likely to walk through the world with defiance and strength. They will have built a heavy shield of irony around their hearts. Sarcasm may be their favorite mode of defence - and they will have ensured in a thousand ways that no one would ever attempt to ask them, even in the briefest, most lighthearted and humorous way, to 'come to mummy or daddy' for a hug. The defensiveness is hugely understandable, but it is not necessarily aligned with the real requirements of maturity. True health would mean recovering an easy and informal contact with one's less robust dimensions; it would mean being able to play the child because one knew one was resolutely the adult, it would mean being able to be 'baby' because one was in no doubt that one had safely overcome the fears and traumas of the defenceless past. The more difficult the early years have been, the more of our undeveloped self must be disavowed, the more we must appear grandiose, impregnable and daunting. Nevertheless, we will know we have acceded to genuine adulthood when we can hold out a protective hand to our frail younger self - and reassure them that we will from now on be their reliable guardians and protectors and allow them to visit us for a cuddle and a play whenever they need to."

    "Title": "How Dreading the Future May Be a Symptom of Your Past",
    "Transcript": "One common kind of mental illness (which doesn't present itself as an illness to us of course, it's far too clever for that) leads us to worry incessantly about the future: to worry about bankruptcy, disgrace, physical collapse, abandonment. What is pernicious about this kind of worrying is that it picks up on genuine features of the here and now; it presents itself as reasonable but, on closer examination, it clearly isn't. There are always a few alarming things going on: there is some turbulence in the economy, there can be things that go wrong with bodies, reputations do rise and fall… But what should eventually alert us to the peculiarity of our position is the duration, scale and repetitiveness of our worries: we should learn to see that we are essentially worried all the time about something. The target may shift, but what is constant is our insecurity about existence. It is in such situations that a therapist may make a hugely useful intervention: they may point out that the way we worry about the future is in fact telling us a huge amount about our past. More specifically, we are worried right now in a way that mirrors the panic we once felt as children; we are greeting the challenges of the adult world with the defenceless panic of the child we once were. What we are doing in the process is exchanging the pain of remembering the difficult past for a sense of foreboding around the future; the catastrophe we fear is going to happen has already happened. So sealed off are our memories, we project them forward, where they greet us as apprehensions of what is to come - rather than identifying themselves as legacies of unmasterable past anxiety. The good therapist becomes aware of the correct source of the anxiety - and doesn't let go of their insight. They will listen politely and generously to our description of our current panic - what will happen in our job? Have we studied enough? What if our enemies gang up on us? But then they will gently try to shift the conversation to the past, to show us that the future looks so fearful because we are being counterproductively loyal to the terrors of an earlier age, which we now need to remember, to feel sad about and then eventually to mourn and move on from. We should be disloyal to those who brought us up in an atmosphere of fear in order to save what remains of life from always appearing doom-laden: we may be trying to stay close to them by continuing to panic alongside them, but we owe it to ourselves to break the circle of worry and to make our future different from the past, by remembering, localising and mourning what belonged to yesterday even as it pretends to be about tomorrow."

    "Title": "Hysteria When Your Partner Is Too Calm",
    "Transcript": "There are arguments in which one person will get so upset that they start to behave in ways that range far beyond the imagined norms of civilised conduct: they speak in a highly pitched voice, they exaggerate, they weep, they beg, their words become almost incoherent; they pull their own hair; they bite their own hand; they roll on the floor. Unsurprisingly, it can become supremely tempting for their partner to assert that this dramatic behaviour means they have evidently gone mad - and to close them down on this score. To press the point home, the unagitated partner may start to speak in a preternaturally calm way, as if addressing an unruly dog or a red-faced two year old. They may assert that, since the partner has grown so unreasonable, there doesn't seem to be any point in continuing the conversation - a conclusion which drives the distressed partner to further paroxysms and convulsions. It is natural to propose that the person who loses their temper in the course of an argument thereby loses any claim to credibility. Whatever point they may be trying to make seems automatically to be invalidated by the fact that they are doing so while in a chaotic state. The only priority seems to be to shift attention to how utterly awful and immature they are being. It is evident: the one who is calm is good; the one who is frothing and spluttering is a cretin. Unfortunately, both partners end up trapped in an unproductive cycle that benefits neither of them. There's a moment when the calm one may turn and say: 'Since you are mad, there's no point in talking to you.' The awareness - in the raging lover's mind - that, as they rant and flail, they are throwing away all possibility of being properly attended to or understood feeds their ever mounting sense of panic: they become yet more demented and exaggerated, further undermining their credibility in the discussion. Hearing their condition diagnosed as insane by the calm one serves to reinforce a suspicion that perhaps they really are mad, which in turn weakens their capacity not to be so. They lose confidence that there might be any reasonable aspect to their distress which could (theoretically) be explained in a clear way if only they could stop crying. 'I'm not going to listen to you any further if you keep making such a fuss,' the calm partner might go on to say - prompting ever more of precisely this 'fuss'. The frustrated one is gradually turned into a case study fit only for clinical psychology or a straight jacket. They are, as we might put it, pathologized, held up as someone who is actually crazy, rather than as an ordinary human who is essentially quite sane but has temporarily lost their self-possession on account of an extremely difficult situation. On the other side of the equation, the person who remains calm is automatically cast - by their own imperturbable nature and subtle skills at public relations - as decent and reasonable. But we should bear in mind that it is at least in theory entirely possible to be cruel, dismissive, stubborn, harsh and wrong - and keep one's voice utterly steady. Just as one can, equally well, be red-nosed, whimpering and incoherent - and have a point. We need to keep in mind a heroically generous attitude: rage and histrionics can be the symptoms of a desperation that sets in when a hugely important intimate truth is being blatantly ignored or denied, without the uncontrolled person being either evil or monstrous. Obviously the method of delivery is drastically unhelpful; obviously it would always be better if we didn't start to cry. But it is not beyond understanding or, in theory at least, forgiveness if we were to do so. It's horrible and frightening to witness someone getting intensely worked up - but with the benefit of perspective, their inner condition calls for deep compassion rather than a lecture. We should remember that only someone who internally felt their life was in danger would end up in a mess in a discussion. We should keep this in mind because sometimes it will be us who fall into a deranged state; we won't always be the aggrieved, cooler-headed party. We should all have a little film of ourselves at our very worst moments from which we replay brief highlights as we witness the other frothing and shouting and so remember that while we ourselves looked mad, our contortions were only the outer signs of an inner agony at being unable to make ourselves understood on a crucial point by the person we relied on. We can stay calm with almost everyone in our lives. If we lose our temper with our partners, it is (at best, in part) because we are so invested in them and our joint futures. We shouldn't invariably hold it against someone that they behave in a stricken way; it isn't (probably) a sign that they are mad or horrible. Rather, as we should have the grace to remember, it is just that they love and depend on us very much."

    "Title": "The Body Keeps the Score",
    "Transcript": "the body keeps the score is the beautiful and suggestive title of a book published in 2014 by a dutch professor of psychiatry at boston university called bessel van der kulk the book has proved immensely significant because it emphasizes an idea that has for too long escaped psychiatrists and psychotherapists vander kulk stresses that people who are suffering emotionally are unlikely to do so just in their minds crucially their symptoms almost always show up in their bodies in the way they sit or breathe and how they hold their shoulders in their sleep patterns in their digestion processes in the way they treat their spots and in their attitude to exercise taking the body more seriously opens up new avenues for both the diagnosis and treatment of emotional unwellness instead of simply seeing a person as a disembodied mind which must talk its way to a cure a therapist is advised to see the body as a kind of score sheet of the emotional experiences that its owner has been through a scoresheet that should be read and attended to as carefully as any mental account to take one example many people who have grown up having to deal with the overwhelming rage of a parent will have learnt to suppress their own anger and their desire to hit back at those who hurt them in their minds they will have become meek and precisely attuned to fulfilling the wishes of others however unreasonable these might be but as importantly in their bodies they will have learnt to be very still almost frozen because a part of them associates the expression of anything exuberant or powerful with the risk of bringing about retaliation from others these people might sit in a particularly stiff way or have an ingrained resistance to running that has nothing to do with laziness what is at stake is a fear of one's own vitality in trying to treat such people van der kulk goes beyond advising traditional talk therapy he would also recommend that they try under the supervision of a therapeutically trained teacher kickboxing or karate competitive running or swimming sports these people might long have resisted because of a cowed relationship to their strength they might also try out rhythmically chanting or drumming thereby additionally releasing pent-up longings to assert one's right to be traumatized people tend to have bodies that are either too alert responding to every breath and touch flinching and bristling at contact or else too numb shut down heavy and immobile treatment seeks to find a more comfortable halfway house between these two extremes vanderkolk's book helps us to think anew of how to deal with people who at the start of their lives were not properly held caressed and soothed in the way that young children desperately need to be in order to feel at home in their own skin as part of their work van der kulk and his team opened up a sensory integration clinic in boston a sort of indoor playground for children and adults where one can get back in touch with a body that was not properly and by loving hands touched or cuddled gently swung from side to side or hung upside down for a giggly moment in the sensory integration clinic under the instruction of a therapist one might dive onto foam-filled mats have a roll around in a ball pool jump on a swing and balance on a beam it sounds childlike and is meant to be offering a serious chance to go back a step to correct a long-standing alienation those who were once neglected by emotionally stunted parents have often almost literally withdrawn from their bodies they own them but they do not properly live in them they might be rendered deeply uncomfortable if anyone touches their shoulders or strokes their back they might intuitively think their body was disgusting because that's how it once seemed in the eyes of those who were meant to look after them for such people vanderkulk might advise a therapeutically informed massage to help rebuild a basic trust in one's skin and limbs as he puts it he wants the body to have experiences that deeply and viscerally contradict the helplessness rage or collapse that resulted from trauma it is no doubt deeply unfortunate that a difficult past appears to give us physical as well as mental symptoms but the body's travails can in vanderkulk's optimistic account also become a source of memory and evidence when our minds have otherwise seized up or fatally doubt the legitimacy of their own feelings we can start to remember what might have happened to us by asking ourselves questions in therapy and at the same time by taking a look at how we are sitting how we breathe and how we feel when someone we love proposes to hold us then we can hope to be healed not only by wise arguments and kind voices however consoling these might be but also by dancing swaying from side to side on a gigantic swing chanting in unison or best of all surrendering ourselves to a very long and very nourishing hug from someone we have quietly dared to trust how to overcome your childhood is a book that teaches us how character is developed the concept of emotional inheritance the formation of our concepts of being good or bad and the impact of parental styles of love on the way we choose adult partners"

    "Title": "How to Keep a Relationship Going",
    "Transcript": "How can you tell whether a relationship is going to last the course - or whether it's doomed to founder? What's the difference between fragile and solid couples? Here are some of the things to look out for: Over-optimism about Relationships Fragile couples tend, paradoxically, to be very hopeful about love. They associate happiness with conflict-free unions. They do not expect, once they have found the person they unwisely see as The One, ever to need to squabble, storm out of a room or feel unhappy for the afternoon. When trouble emerges, as it inevitably does, they do not greet it as a sign that love is progressing as it should; rather as alarming evidence that their relationship may be illegitimate and fundamentally flawed. Their hopes tire them for the patient tasks of diplomatic negotiation and routine maintenance. Out of touch with Pain Fragile couples tend not to be good detectives of their own sufferings. They may be both unhappy and yet unsure as to the actual causes of their dissatisfactions; they know that something is wrong in their unions, but they can't easily trace the catalysts. They can't zero in on the way that it was the lack of trust in them around money that rankles or that it has been their behaviour towards a demanding youngest child that has been hurting. They lash out in vague or inaccurate directions, their attacks either unfairly general or unconvincingly specific. Shame A shamed person has fundamental doubts about their right to exist: somewhere in the past, they have been imbued with an impression that they do not matter very much, that their feelings should be ignored, that their happiness is not a priority, that their words do not count. Once they are in a couple, shamed people hurt like anyone else, but their capacity to turn their hurt into something another person can understand, and be touched by, is recklessly weak. Shamed people will sulk rather than speak, hide rather than divulge, feel secretly wretched rather than candidly complain. It is frequently very late, far too late, by the time shamed people finally let their lover know more about the nature of their desperation. Excessive Anxiety Complaining well requires an impression that not everything depends on the complaint being heard perfectly. Were the lesson to go wrong, were the other to prove intransigent, one could survive and take one's love elsewhere. Not everything is at stake in an argument. The other hasn't ruined one's life. One therefore doesn't need to scream, hector, insist or nag. One can deliver a complaint with some of the nonchalance of a calm teacher who wants an audience to learn but can bear it if they don't; one could always say what one has on one's minds tomorrow, or the next day. Excessive Pride It takes an inner dignity not to mind too much about having to level complaints around things that could sound laughably 'small' or that leave one open to being described as petty or needy. With too much pride and fear, it can become unbearable to admit that one has been upset since lunch because they didn't take one's hand on a walk, or that one wishes so much that they would be readier to hug one last thing at night. One has to feel quite grown up inside not to be offended by one's own more childlike appetites for reassurance and comfort. It is an achievement to know how to be strong about one's vulnerability. One may have said, rather too many times, from behind a slammed door, in a defensive tone, 'No, nothing is wrong whatsoever. Go away', when secretly longing to be comforted and understood like a weepy, upset child. Hopelessness about Dialogue Fragile couples often come together with few positive childhood memories of conversations working out: early role models may simply have screamed and then despaired of one another. They may never have witnessed disagreements eventually morphing into mutual understanding and sympathy. They would deeply love to be understood, but they can bring precious few resources to the task of making themselves so. None of these factors mean a couple will split up, but they are generators of the states of emotional disconnection that can eventually break two people apart. Outwardly, things may seemingly be well. A couple may have an interesting social life, some lovely children, a new apartment. But a more judicious analysis will reveal an unexpected degree of risk. The good news is that knowing a little about the risk factors can help us identify them in good time - and, with the help of good advice, for example, from the School of Life, fix them while there is still time."

complaint regularly aired around many careers is that in order to succeed at them there is nowadays no option but to sell out it appears that we will inevitably face a choice between authenticity and poverty on the one hand and idiocy and wealth on the other we're familiar with the complaint in the arts of course but the same dilemma shows up when an interesting restaurant seems unable to make a profit when a specialist bread company goes into receivership when a garden supply firm focusing on rare native plants can't get a foothold in the market behind the complaint lies a very understandable but at the same time very ambitious yearning that our most passionately held beliefs and enthusiasms should relatively painlessly simply by virtue of their merits become high priorities for others young children are particularly prone to this touching assumption they may on meeting a new adult enthusiastically suggest that they join them in playing a favorite game perhaps brew something on a miniature kitchen stove or impersonate one of their dolls which shows how hard it is for a child to grasp how alien its pleasures might be to another person children aren't silly they are just highly attuned to their own nature and spontaneously convinced that others may share it they are in a naive but representative way illustrating an instinct that stays with us all of our lives the supposition that others will and must be moved by what moves us it's tempting to arrive at a despairing conclusion that the economy is inherently devoted to delivering a personal insult to the better aspects of human nature the truth is a lot less vindictive but the tendency for the market to overlook some of our more sincere and earnest efforts is real and founded on a raft of identifiable stubborn forces in economic and psychological life one of the most basic of these forces is choice it's in the nature of a growing successful economy always to expand the range of choice offers to a consumer and thereby always to minimize the a priori claims of any one product or service we can track the characteristic features of this development in relation to the media in 1952 a bbc radio broadcast of beethoven's fifth symphony attracted an audience of 5 million listeners approximately 16 percent of the uk's adult population today such a broadcast would claim a fraction of these numbers what explains the difference is not as some cultural pessimists might claim that the uk population has over a few generations become a great deal less sensitive to the force of german romantic music the fundamental difference is that today's audience has many more options in 1952 there were very few competing sources of entertainment people listened on mass to the classical end of bbc radio because there was nothing much else to do this rather nicely gave certain high brow things more opportunity to be attended to but it also meant that many substandard services and products could enjoy a far larger role than their intrinsic merit warranted there is a second reason why modern audiences are likely to sidestep opportunities for high-minded consumption because they are so exhausted modern work demands a punishing amount from us we typically return from our jobs at the days close in a state of severe depletion in such a condition the products and services for which we can be in the mood have to be a very particular sort we're probably too brutalized to care very much about the suffering of others we may have endured too much tedium to stay patient with arguments that are reticent and subtle we may hate ourselves a bit too much to want to eat and drink only what's good for us our lives may be too lacking in meaning to concentrate only on what is meaningful to counterbalance what's happened at work we may gravitate instinctively towards what's excessively sweet salty distracting easy colorful explosive sexual or sentimental this collectively creates a vicious circle what we consume ends up determining what we can produce and in turn the quality of jobs that are on offer so long as we have only the emotional resources to consume at the more narcotic and compromised end of the market we'll only be generating employment that is itself rather challenged in meaning and compromised in dignity the price we pay for a marketplace that refuses to support high-minded efforts isn't just practical and economic it is also at some level emotional one of our greatest cravings is to be recognized and accepted for who we are we long for careful insightful appreciation of our characters and interests this was if things went tolerably well a bit like what happened to us in childhood when a kindly adult through the quality of their love spared us any requirement to impress or as we might put it to market ourselves we didn't in those early years need assiduously to sell who we were we didn't have to smile in exaggerated ways sound happier than we were put on seductive accents or compress what we had to say in memorable jingles we could take our time hesitate whisper be a little elusive and complex and as serious as we needed to be certain that another would be there to find and accept us everything we learned of love in those days ran counter to the mechanisms of commercialization no wonder if we harbor within us a degree of instinctive revulsion about selling out the need not to sell ourselves aggressively was not just part of an earlier simpler point in the history of the world as scholars rightly point out it was more poignantly

    "Title": "What Is Mental Health?",
    "Transcript": "So efficient and hushed are our brains in their day to day operations, we are apt to miss what an extraordinary and complicated achievement it is to feel mentally well. A mind in a healthy state is, in the background, continually performing a near-miraculous set of manoeuvres that underpin our moods of clear-sightedness and purpose. To appreciate what mental health might be (and therefore what its opposite involves), we might take a moment to consider some of what will be going on in the folds of an optimally-functioning mind: First and foremost, a healthy mind is an editing mind, an organ that manages to sieve, from thousands of stray, dramatic, disconcerting or horrifying thoughts, those particular ideas and sensations that actively need to be entertained in order for us to direct our lives effectively. Partly this means keeping at bay punitive and critical judgements that might want to tell us repeatedly how disgraceful and appalling we are - long after harshness has ceased to serve any useful purpose. When we are interviewing for a new job or taking someone on a date, a healthy mind doesn't force us to listen to inner voices that insist on our unworthiness. It allows us to talk to ourselves as we would to a friend. At the same time, a healthy mind resists the pull of unfair comparisons. It doesn't constantly allow the achievements and successes of others to throw us off course and reduce us to a state of bitter inadequacy. It doesn't torture us by continually comparing our condition to that of people who have, in reality, had very different upbringings and trajectories through life. A well-functioning mind recognises the futility and cruelty of constantly finding fault with its own nature. Along the way, a healthy mind keeps a judicious grip on the faucet of fear. It knows that, in theory, there is an endless number of things that we could worry about: a blood vessel might fail, a scandal might erupt, the plane's engines could sheer from their wings… But it has a good sense of the distinction between what could conceivably happen and what is in fact likely to happen - and it is able to leave us in peace as regards the wilder eventualities of fate, confident that awful things will either not unfold or could be dealt with ably enough if ever they did so. A healthy mind avoids catastrophic imaginings: it knows that there are broad and stable stone steps, not a steep and slippery incline, between itself and disaster. A healthy mind has compartments with heavy doors that shut securely. It can compartmentalise where it needs to. Not all thoughts belong at all moments. While talking to a grandmother, the mind prevents the emergence of images of last's nights erotic fantasies; while looking after a child, it can repress its more cynical and misanthropic insights. Aberrant thoughts about jumping on a train line or harming oneself with a sharp knife can remain brief peculiar flashes rather than repetitive fixations. A healthy mind has mastered the techniques of censorship. A healthy mind can quieten its own buzzing preoccupations in o rder, at times, to focus on the world beyond itself. It can be present and engaged with what and who is immediately around. Not everything it could feel has to be felt at every moment. It can be a good listener. A healthy mind combines an appropriate suspicion of certain people with a fundamental trust in humanity. It can take an intelligent risk with a stranger. It doesn't extrapolate from life's worst moments in order to destroy the possibility of anything good emerging with a new acquaintance. A healthy mind knows how to hope; it identifies and then hangs on tenaciously to a few reasons to keep going. Grounds for despair, anger and sadness are, of course, all around. But the healthy mind knows how to bracket negativity in the name of endurance. It clings to evidence of what is still beautiful and kind. It remembers to appreciate; it can - despite everything - still look forward to a hot bath, some dried fruit or dark chocolate, a chat with a friend, or a satisfying day of work. It refuses to let itself be silenced by all the many sensible arguments in favour of rage and despondency. Outlining some of the features of a healthy mind helps us to identify what can go awry when we fall ill. We should acknowledge the extent to which mental illness is ultimately as common, and as essentially unshameful, as its bodily counterpart. True mental health involves a frank acceptance of how much ill health there will have to be in even the most ostensibly competent and meaningful life. And we should be no more reluctant to seek help than we are when we develop a chest infection or a sore knee - and should consider ourselves no less worthy of love and sympathy."

    "Title": "How Unloving Parents Generate Self-Hating Children",
    "Transcript": "(1) A central fact about early childhood is that babies are born into the world entirely at the mercy of others. They have no native strength, intelligence or utility, they cannot fight or complain, walk away or argue their case, their survival depends solely on their capacity to look up from their cots with vast, innocent, beautiful eyes and charm their parents into caring for them. It's their power to attract love that ensures they will be fed and clothed, protected and kept alive.w (2) In exchange for this nurture, young children readily offer their parents or caregivers unconditional admiration. They naturally adore and are boundlessly impressed by those who pick them up and bathe them, warm their milk and change their sheets. They are in awe at these giant people who know how to turn on a washing machine and kick a ball over a tree. There is - at this stage - no innate desire whatever to question or doubt figures of authority. (3) Given what is at stake, it follows that small children are instinctively, hugely sensitive to how well they are doing at getting their admired protectors on their side. If they feel they are loved, they can relax into themselves and get on with the many other pressing priorities of early childhood: working out how to eat solids, figuring out what a plug socket is, how a button functions, what words are and how soap bubbles form. (4) But if love is in more restricted supply, the picture grows a whole lot more complicated. There are childhoods in which, for a variety of reasons, parents fail to be charmed as they might be. They leave the baby to scream, they shout at one another, there might be violence and hysteria, lethargic despair and terror. The young child knows instinctively it is in grave danger, if the situation is not somehow corrected, in extremis, it may be left on a hillside to die. (5) At this point, our biology initiates a desperate yet darkly logical process. The young child starts to try a lot harder. It redoubles its efforts to charm, to be good, to do what could be expected of it, to smile and to ingratiate itself. It wonders what may be wrong with itself to explain the parental disapproval and harm - and doesn't feel any alternative but to search in its own character and behaviour for answers. (6) At the same time, the child resists what might - from an adult perspective - seem like the obvious move: to get annoyed with and blame the adults in the vicinity who are not looking after it as they should. But such a bold thought does not belong to the defencelessness of the early years. We are in no position to mount a challenge to our protectors when we can hardly reach the door handle, let alone turn on a tap; we need to have our own front door key and bank account before cynicism is a realistic option. It is far more intuitive to wonder why we are horrid than to complain of being unfairly and unkindly treated. (7) Small children therefore naturally turn injury done to them into dislike of themselves. They ask not so much 'Why does my parent fail to care for me?' as 'How might I have failed this admirable person?' They hate themselves rather than doubt those who should be protecting them, shame replaces anger. It feels, on balance, like the safer option. (8) A vicious spiral of self- hatred then sets in. The unloved growing child wonders constantly about their faults. Their parent may be alcoholic, narcissistic, sadistic or depressed; they may never cook a proper meal or shout intemperately from their bedroom, but none of that matters in the slightest. The parent cannot be envisaged as anything other than substantially impressive. To explain the lack of love from the paragons of parenthood, it must be that the child is an awful person, they must be stupid and mean, selfish and slow, physically repulsive and irritating and shallow. (9) As childhood gets left behind, much of this dynamic is forgotten. The adolescent and young adult overlooks exactly what went on, they cannot necessarily think clearly of the early years - and parental figures may be keen that they never do so. The former child can't tell any more that their feeling of shame has specific origins, it can feel like something they might have been born with, a natural phenomenon, like bad weather or the flu. (10) Liberation awaits us when we dare to take on board a highly implausible idea: that our self-hatred, far from being inevitable, is an internalisation of early deprivation and that far from needing to revere and admire those who denied us love, we are in a position to understand, to question, to be annoyed and to mourn what we did not receive. We are not so despicable after all, we've just - till now - lacked any better ideas to explain why we didn't manage to charm those who should have loved us from the start."

    "Title": "The Secret Power of Gratitude",
    "Transcript": "Life continually requires that we write down a few words of thanks: for holidays, meals, presents or people's place in our hearts. However, too often, our messages end up flat or somewhat unconvincing; we say that the dinner was 'wonderful', the present 'brilliant' and the holiday 'the best ever', all of which may be true while failing to get at what truly touched or moved us. To render our messages more effective, we might take a lesson from an unexpected quarter: the history of art. Many paintings and poems are in effect a series of thank you notes to parts of the world. They are thank yous for the sunset in springtime, a river valley at dawn, the last days of autumn or the face of a loved one. What distinguishes great from mediocre art is in large measure the level of detail with which the world has been studied. A talented artist is, first and foremost, someone who takes us into the specifics of the reasons why an experience or place felt valuable. They don't merely tell us that spring is 'nice', they zero in on the particular contributing factors to this niceness: leaves that have the softness of a newborn's hands, the contrast between a warm sun and a sharp breeze, the plaintive cry of baby blackbirds. The more the poet moves from generalities to specifics, the more the scene comes alive in our minds. The same holds true in painting. A great painter goes beneath a general impression of pleasure in order to select and emphasise the truly attractive features of the landscape: they show the sunlight filtering through the leaves of the trees and reflecting off of a pool of water in the road; they draw attention to the craggy upper slopes of a mountain or the way a sequence of ridges and valleys open up in the distance. They've asked themselves with unusual rigour what is it that they particularly appreciated about a scene and faithfully transcribed their salient impressions. Some of the reason why great artists are rare is that our minds are not well set up to understand why we feel as we do. We register our emotions in broad strokes and derive an overall sense of our moods long before we grasp the basis upon which they rest. We are bad at travelling upstream from our impressions to their source, it feels frustrating to have to ask too directly what was really pleasing about a present or why exactly a person seemed charming to have dinner with. But we can be confident that if our minds have been affected, the reasons why they have been so will be lodged somewhere in consciousness as well, waiting to be uncovered with deftness and patience. We stand to realise that it wasn't so much that the food was 'delicious' but that the potatoes in particular had an intriguing rosemary and garlic flavour to them. A friend wasn't just 'nice'; they brought a hugely sensitive and generous tone to bear in asking us what it had been like for us in adolescence after our dad died. And the camera wasn't just a 'great present'; it has an immensely satisfying rubbery grip and a reassuringly clunky shutter sound that evokes a sturdier, better older world. The details will be there, waiting for us to catch them through our mental sieve. Praise works best the more specific it can be. We know this in love; the more a partner can say what it is they appreciate about us, the more real their affection can feel. It is when they've studied the shape of our fingers, when they've recognised and appreciated the quirks of our character, when they've clocked the words we like or the way we end a phone call that the praise starts to count. The person who has given a dinner party or sent us a present is no different. They too hunger for praise in its specific rather than general forms. We don't have to be great artists to send effective thank you notes: we just need to locate and hold on tightly to two or three highly detailed reasons for our gratitude."

    "Title": "To Have or Not to Have Children",
    "Transcript": "Modern societies are pretty much in agreement on this score: having children is one of the most meaningful and delightful moves anyone can make. Couples who do not – for whatever reason – have children tend to be automatically almost universally pitied and are assumed to have been denied the chance to have offspring by biology. That one might freely choose not to have children, and yet be reasonably content with one's choice, remains one of the most disturbing and unfathomed of all modern positions. The basic dynamics of whether or not to have children follow the very same pattern that we see across a range of other so-called great choices in emotional life: whether or not to get married, whether or not to stay faithful, whether to follow the path of reason or the calls of the heart…We observe a very strong desire to try to identify the 'right' choice accompanied by a frighteningly utopian belief that, once this choice has been located, we will be able to flourish and find peace.But the reality is very different, much more sombre and more interesting: the large dilemmas of emotional life generally have no 'answer' in the sense of a response that doesn't – somewhere along the line – entail a great loss and an element of extraordinary sacrifice. Whatever we choose will, in this sense, be wrong, and leave us regretting some features of the choices we did not make. There is no such thing as a cost-free choice, a line of argument which continues (oddly) to create surprise in contemporary life. Making a good choice simply involves focusing on what variety of suffering we are best suited to – rather than aiming with utopian zeal to try to avoid grief and regret altogether. Consider, for example, the varieties of suffering that are on offer on both sides of the faithful/unfaithful ledger: both options will at moments be very miserable, so – when weighing up how to lead our lives – we should work on knowing as much as possible about our specific taste in misery. Let's look at a table; Monogamy: the Misery, a Sense of Confinement, a Correct impression that 'life is elsewhere', Irritability, Narrow horizons, Sexual abandonment, What about on the other side: Mulitple partners.  What will be the misery there? There will be chaos, angry ex's, loneliness long term, Damaged children, Guilt. The very same kind of trade-offs exist over the question of children. No honest experience of parenting is complete without an intermittent very strong impression that in some ways children are both the meaning of one's life and the cause of the ruin of one's life. Children: the Misery Disappointment with oneself as a parent, Disappointment with how they turn out, Guilt, exhaustion, lost opportunity Sense of perpetuating human suffering, House sticky everywhere.  What about no Children: What's the Misery there?  Society's constant message that one has 'missed out' Loneliness/boredom Lack of constant distraction/calls on one's time… Sentimental longing for comfort of children by the time one reaches the nursing home. The insight that all choices are, in a sense, hellish, was best expressed by the early 19th century Danish Existential philosopher Soren Kierkegaard, who summed up our options in a playful, but bleakly realistic and exasperated outburst in his masterpiece, \"Either/Or\": “Marry, and you will regret it; don't marry, you will also regret it; marry or don't marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world's foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world's foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it… Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don't hang yourself, you'll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.” We deserve pity – as does everyone else. We will make disastrous decisions, we will form mistaken relationships, we will embark on misguided careers, we will invest our savings foolishly, we will spend years on friendships with unreliable idiots – and we will get it mostly wrong around children. But we can we be consoled by a bitter truth: there are no painless options, for the conditions of existence are intrinsically rather than accidentally frustrating. We can't get through the tunnel of life without a mauling. For those of us contemplating whether or not to have children, the message is dark but consoling in its bleakness: you will be at points very unhappy whatever you choose. With either option, you will feel that you have ruined your life – and you will be correct. We do not need to add to our misery by insisting that there would have been another, better way. There is, curiously, relief to be found in the knowledge of the inevitability of suffering. It is, in the end, never darkness that dooms us, but the wrong sort of hope in that most cruel of fantasies: 'the right choice'."

    "Title": "What Is Emotional Neglect? And How to Cope",
    "Transcript": "When we imagine the difficulties involved in a so-called 'bad childhood', we most readily think in terms of children who are physically harmed - beaten, underfed, sexually abused - or else treated with active contempt: screamed at, blamed, put down, mocked and tormented. Such harrowing images make it hard for us to picture that there might be another, in many ways more prevalent yet just as damaging form of injury to which children may be exposed. In this case, there is no physical violence, there is no taunting or shouting. It looks - at first glance - as if all must be well. But that would be to miss the particular kind of wound that can be inflicted through what psychologists term 'emotional neglect.' We're so used to focusing on abuses that spring from interventions, we forget those that can equally painfully flow from absence. The emotionally neglected child isn't screamed at or hit, locked up or jeered at. they are just - often very subtly - ignored. A parent doesn't smile at them very much. There is never any time to take a look at the drawing they just did or the story they wrote. No one remembers their stuffed animal's name. No one notices that they are looking sad and that the first day at school might have been very difficult. There's always something more urgent to do than spend time with them (perhaps another sibling to think about or the demands of work or of their partner. There might be a lot of parties as well). The parent seems in no way charmed or interested. There are no cuddles or hair ruffles, there are no nicknames or terms of endearment. Birthdays get forgotten. Tears aren't dried or consoled. The parent doesn't look the child in the eye. They might, shortly after the birth, go off and live in another household. None of this may seem - at first glance - to be especially bad, particularly because the insidious behaviour is largely invisible. It is compatible with all kinds of outward signs of healthy family life. But that isn't to say that no damage is being done. The psychologist William James presciently observed that it might as bad, if not worse, to be on the receiving end of indifference as of physical torment: 'No more fiendish punishment could be devised, were such a thing possible, than that one should be turned loose in society and remain absolutely unnoticed by all the members thereof. If no one turned around when we entered, answered when we spoke, or minded what we did, but if every person we met “cut us dead”, and acted as if we were non-existent things, a kind of rage and impotent despair would before long well up in us, from which the cruellest bodily torture would be a relief.' A crucial fact of psychological life is the disinclination of any child to think there is something wrong with its parent; it will go to almost any lengths to prevent the idea emerging that its parent may be mentally unwell or fundamentally brutish. It will remain attached and obsessed by the most vicious and uncaring figure whom an objective observer might see through in an instant. The child will do anything rather than entertain the idea that an injury has been done to it by its own progenitor - especially if the parent is charming to other people and impressive in the professional sphere. The child will just assume that there must be something deeply wrong with itself to justify the indifference. It must have failed in some way, it must in its essence be profoundly ugly, repulsive, deformed or lacking. This is the only conceivable explanation for the blankness with which their existence is received. The adult who emerges from such a complicated, veiled childhood is likely to be in a confused state. On the surface, they may experience only good will and a continued desire to please their early caregivers. But deep within themselves, they may feel lacerating doubt, paranoia and self-contempt. To numb such feelings, they may take to drink or develop numbing, calming addictions to keep themselves from constant encounters with their perceived repulsiveness. A measure of resolution comes when we can take on board the term 'emotional neglect' and treat it, and thereby our own stories, with requisite seriousness. Our childhood sorrows may not rank among the most obvious or newsworthy, but they may be substantial and genuine nevertheless. Our levels of shame attest as much. We were not hit, but we were injured. We failed to receive the love that makes people firm and whole, that allows them to feel authentic and deserving, that prevents them from being impressed by those who mistreat them and that stops them wanting to kill themselves when they mess up. We hear so much about the virtues of bravery, we miss out on the importance of learning more regularly to feel - with appropriate cathartic intent - usefully sorry for ourselves."

    "Title": "When We Fall Mentally Ill...",
    "Transcript": "For a long time, we may cope well enough. We make it to work e very morning, we give pleasant summaries of our lives to friends, we smile over dinner. We aren't totally balanced, but there's little way of knowing how difficult things might be for other people, and what we have a right to expect in terms of contentment and peace of mind. We probably tell ourselves to stop being self-indulgent and redouble our efforts to feel worthy through achievement. We are probably world experts in not feeling sorry for ourselves. Decades may pass. It's not uncommon for the most serious mental conditions to remain undiagnosed for half a lifetime. We simply don't notice that we are, beneath the surface, chronically anxious, filled with self-loathing and close to overwhelming despair and rage. This too simply ends up feeling normal. Until one day, finally, something triggers a collapse. It might be a crisis at work, a reversal in our career plans or a mistake we've made over a task. It might be a romantic failure, someone leaving us or a realisation that we are profoundly unhappy with a partner we had thought might be our long-term future. Alternatively, we feel mysteriously exhausted and sad, to the extent that we can't face anything any more, even a family meal or a conversation with a friend. Or we are struck by unmanageable anxiety around everyday challenges, like addressing our colleagues or going into a shop. We're swamped by a sense of doom and imminent catastrophe. We sob uncontrollably. We are in a mental crisis and, if we are lucky, we will know to put up the white flag at once. There is nothing shameful or rare in our condition; we have fallen ill, as so many before us have. We need not compound our sickness with a sense of embarrassment. This is what happens when one is a delicate human facing the hurtful, alarming and always uncertain conditions of existence. Recovery can start the moment one admits one no longer has a clue how to cope. The roots of the crisis almost certainly go a long way back. Things will not have been right in certain areas for an age, possibly forever. There will have been grave inadequacies in the early days, things that were said and done to us that should never have occurred and bits of reassurance and care that were ominously missed out on. On top of this, adult life will have layered on difficulties which we were not well equipped to know how to endure. It will have applied pressure along our most tender, invisible faultlines. Our illness is trying to draw attention to our problems, but it can only do so inarticulately, by throwing up coarse and vague symptoms. It knows how to declare that we are worried and sad, but it can't tell us what about and why. That will be the work of patient investigation, over months and years, probably in the company of experts. The illness contains the cure, but it has to be teased out and its original inarticulacy interpreted. Something from the past is crying out to be recognised - and will not leave us alone until we have given it its due. It may seem - at points - like a death sentence but we are, beneath the crisis, being given an opportunity to restart our lives on a more generous, kind and realistic footing. There is an art to being ill - and to daring, at last, to listen to what our pain is trying to tell us."

    "Title": "What Love Really Is and Why It Matters",
    "Transcript": "There is so much talk of love in our societies, it would be natural to think that we must by now know what it is and why it counts. Love is the excited feeling we get in the presence of someone of unusual accomplishment and talent – great intelligence or beauty for the most part – whom we hope will reciprocate our interest and whom we badly want to touch, caress and one day share our lives with. This definition sounds so plausible and enjoys such powerful cultural endorsement, we are apt to miss another vision of love altogether, this one focused not so much on the appreciation of strength as on a tolerance of, and kindness towards, what is weak and misshapen. According to this vision, we display love when, on the way home, we come across an itinerant drunk – weather-beaten and dishevelled, beer addled and ranting – and do not, for once, turn away and instead make the momentous internal step (with all the eventual outward actions that might follow) of considering them as a version of ourselves, prey to the same passions and distempers, visited by the same longings, upset by similar losses and worthy of their own share of compassion and tolerance. We show love too when we see a well dressed person shouting grandly and imperiously at an airport, filled with self-righteousness, apparently bloated on their own self-regard, and do not dismiss them immediately as insane or entitled, but instead, take the trouble to see the frightened vulnerable self beneath the bluster, when we grow curious as to the sickness of the soul that might be operating just below the surface and are able to wonder what has hurt them – and why they might be so scared. We show love when we see a small child throwing themselves on the floor in the aisles of a supermarket, shouting that they want 'it' again and again, and do not focus only on how inconvenient it is to steer our trolley around them and how piercing and maddening their screams are, but also feel how much we understand their frustration – and would want to tell them that their pain is in its general form ours too and that we would also like to rest against a kindly adult's chest and hear 'I know, I know' until the pain ebbs. However many songs celebrate the act, it is no particular feat to love someone who is on their best behaviour, who looks beautiful and moves with grace through the world. What really cries out for our attention is the love of what is crooked and gnarled, damaged and self-disgusted. In this definition, love is the effort required to imagine oneself more accurately into the life of another human who has not made it in way easy to admire or even like them. In the Western tradition, it was the man from Nazareth who gave us the most memorable demonstrations of this sort of love, who made it seem glamorous to love differently from the Romans and the Greeks, to love the prostitute, the prisoner and the sinner, to show love to a wretch, a catastrophe and an enemy. To extrapolate from the approach, a truly Christian dating app would not merely highlight the beautiful and the dazzling, it wouldn't allow us to swipe away every slightly displeasing person at a stroke but would instead stop us arbitrarily at photographs of hugely challenging figures – malodorous lepers, shocking reprobates – and would command, with all the authority of divine intonation, 'Love! Here where it would feel so natural and so easy to hate, your duty is to love…' It's a measure of how we far forgotten everything to do with this sort of love, how committed we are to love-as-admiration, that such a command would sound so peculiar and so laughable. Yet we might say that nothing is more important than this love, that this is the love that rescues nations from intolerance, that pauses wars, that halts recriminations, that calms furies and that allows civilisation to continue. True love involves precisely not giving someone what is their due, but giving them what they need in order to survive."

    "Title": "Sleep and Mental Health",
    "Transcript": "Part of the reason why many of us have a tangled and unhelpful relationship to sleep can be traced back to the way we first learnt about the subject many years ago. Parents of small children tend to be very careful about bedtimes. They favour early nights, they give their babies plenty of naps throughout the day, they think a lot about black-out curtains, they are quick to diagnose many instances of bad temper as stemming from a background deficit of rest and while they may be indulgent in some areas, they are likely to be entirely implacable in any negotiation over routines: seven p.m. lights out, no ifs ands or buts. None of this is remotely altruistic: tired small children are a nightmare to look after. Every reversal becomes a drama, every disappointment turns into a catastrophe and every excitement shifts into mania. A half-way decent adult existence is impossible alongside a tired child. Self-interest necessitates totalitarianism. But while a draconian philosophy is useful in the early years, it can set up an awkward dynamic in an off-spring's mind as adolescence sets in. Growing up and asserting one's independence and individuality can then become associated with a newly defiant and cavalier approach to bedtimes. Not for a newly empowered young adult the strictures and denying rules of the past. Why bother to put the light out by ten or even midnight or one in the morning, given that one is so obviously no longer a toddler? What is thereby missed is how much every adult shares in a young child's sensitivity to a shortfall of sleep. Just like our younger selves, we do not have an impregnable command over a reasonable view of our own prospects or condition. There are many different ways of telling the story of our lives, ranging from an optimistic tale of progress mixed with noble defeats to a tragic narrative of thorough-going stupidity and unforgivable errors. What can determine the difference between madness and sanity may be nothing grander, but then again nothing more critical, than how long our minds have been allowed to lie on a pillow in the preceding hours. It's especially unfortunate that this connection is so easy to miss. No bells go off in our minds warning us that we are running low on nocturnal nectar. As a result, we start to believe many dark things with doomful ease: that our relationship is over, that everyone hates us, that our lives are meaningless and that human existence is a cosmic joke 'When we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago,' knew Friedrich Nietzsche. We go mad from tiredness long before we notice the role of exhaustion in stealing our sanity. The thinking we do when tired is vindictive and sloppy. It misses important details, it gives the advantage over to our enemies, it hands victory to the evangelists of sadness. Being careful doesn't just apply to the night. At varied points in the day, when possible and we are overwhelmed, we should know to stop, hoist the white flag and have a nap. When we lie in bed, it makes sense to think of ourselves as akin to a smaller, furry mammal, a rabbit or perhaps a squirrel. We should lift our knees up very close to our chests and pull the duvet over our heads. We might soak a whole patch of the pillow with our tears. We should - metaphorically - stroke our own weary foreheads as a loving adult might once have done. Grown-up life is intolerably hard and we should be allowed to know and lament this. We shouldn't feel weird in our weepy squirrel position. Other people go to immense lengths to hide that they do, or would like to do, the very same sort of thing. We need to know someone extremely well - better than we know 99% of humanity - before they will let us in on the scale of their despair and anxiety and their longings for a cosy, safe nook. It looks child-like but it is in fact the essence of adulthood to recognise, and give space for, one's regressive tendencies. What the curled squirrel position indicates is that not all mental problems can be solved by active reasoning. Not thinking consciously should also be deemed a part of the mind's work. Being curled up in bed allows our minds to do a different sort of thinking, the sort that can take place when we are no longer impatiently looking for results, when the usual hectoring conscious self takes a break and lets the mind do what it will for a time. It is then, paradoxically, that certain richer, more creative ideas can have the peace and freedom to coalesce - as they may do when we are out for a walk in the countryside or idling while having a drink in a cafe. Thinking isn't what we do best when it's all we're meant to do. There remain plenty of reasons to live. We simply may not be able to see them until we have allowed ourselves the privilege of a weepy nap or a long night's sleep."

    "Title": "Mental Illness and Reasons to Live",
    "Transcript": "When we are feeling well in our minds, we hardly notice that we might be harbouring in ourselves anything as formal or as dramatic-sounding as 'reasons to live.' We simply assume that we like life itself and that it must be natural and inevitable to do so. And yet a broad appetite for life is, on close inspection, never simply that; our apparently general buoyancy must covertly rest on a range of specific elements that, while we may not bother to itemise them, have their own and distinct identities nevertheless. It's only when a crisis hits and our mood starts to drop that we may for the first time start to feel, with acute sorrow, what these 'reasons to live' might have been all along; it's as we lose our reasons that we understand them with uncommon clarity. We realise why we have for years bothered to rise out of bed with energy and relative good humour, put up with inconveniences, struggled to get ourselves across to others and looked forward to tomorrow - and wonder in dismay how we will from now on ever have the will and courage to continue. Our engagement with life might have been bound up with, the enjoyment of work or of reputation, the companionship of a child or of a friend, the agility of our bodies or the creativity of our minds. Denied such advantages, we don't merely miss out on an aspect of life, the whole of it loses its purpose. Secondary satisfactions - whether from a holiday or a book, a dinner with old acquaintances or a hobby - cannot compensate. The hedonic scaffolding of our lives disintegrates. We may not actively try to kill ourselves, but we can't count as quite alive either. We are going through the motions; living corpses following a script drained of meaning. When we say that someone has fallen mentally ill, what we are frequently pointing to is the loss of long-established reasons to remain alive. And so the task ahead is to make a series of interventions, as what counts. We may need to forgive ourselves for a fearsome degree of idiocy, give up on a need to feel exceptional, surrender worldly ambitions and cease once and for all to imagine that our minds could be as logical or as reliable as we had hoped. We may continue to live simply because every human deserves understanding - and because we are trying our best in the only way we know how. If there is any advantage to going through a mental crisis of the worst kind, it is that - on the other side of it - we will have ended up choosing life rather than merely assuming it to be the unremarkable norm. We, the ones who have crawled back from the darkness, may be disadvantaged in a hundred ways, but at least we will have had to find, rather than assumed or inherited, some reasons why we are here. Every day we continue will be a day earned back from death and our satisfactions will be all the more more intense and our gratitude more profound for having been consciously arrived at. The challenge from the present sickness can be mapped out in its essential form: one day to reach a small but robust and persuasive list of reasons to continue to be."

    "Title": "Why You Are Not a Loser",
    "Transcript": "Our societies have advanced tendencies to label certain people 'winners' and others - logically enough - 'losers'. Aside from the evident meanness of this categorisation, the underlying problem with it is the suggestion that life might be a unitary, singular race, at the conclusion to which one could neatly rank all the competitors from highest to lowest. And yet the more confusing and complex truth is that life is really made up of a number of races that unfold simultaneously over very different terrain and with different sorts of cups and medals in view. There are races for money, fame and prestige of course - and these attract many spectators and in some social circles, the bulk of the coverage. But there are also races that measure other kinds of prowess worth venerating. There is a race for who can remain calmest in the face of frustration. There is a race for who can be kindest to children. There is a race measuring how gifted someone is at friendship. There are races focused on how attentive someone is to the evening sky or how good they are at deriving pleasure from autumn fruits. Despite our enthusiasm for sorting out competitors into neat ranks, a striking fact about the multi-race event of life is, quite simply, that no one is ever able to end up a winner in every genre of competition available. Furthermore, prowess in one kind of race seems to militate against one's chances of success in others. Winning at being ruthlessly successful in business seems not - for example - generally to go hand in hand with any real ability at the race to appreciate the sky or find pleasure in figs. Those who are terrific at gaining fame tend to be hampered when it comes to competing in the race that measures the ability to be patient around thoughtful but underconfident three year old children. We cannot - it seems - be winners at everything. Those who appear to be carrying off all the prizes and are lauded in certain quarters as superhuman athletes of life cannot, on closer examination, really be triumphing across the board in any such way. They are bound to be making a deep mess of some of the less familiar or prestigious races they are entered for; in certain corners of the stadium, they'll be falling over, tripping up, complaining loudly about track conditions and, perhaps, sourly denigrating the whole event as useless and not worth participating in. If one cannot be a winner at everything, it follows that one cannot be a loser at everything either. When we have failed in certain races in the mille-athlon of life, we retain ample opportunities to train and develop our strength to win in others. We may never again be able to compete in the race for fame, honour or money, but it's still entirely open to us to compete in the race for kindness, friendship and forgiveness. We may even win at the not insignificant race for enjoying one's own company or sleeping very soundly and without anxiety for many hours. There is no such thing as a winner or a loser per se. There is only a person who has won in some areas and messed up in others. And, to go deeper, someone whose talent at winning in one sort of race means they must naturally and almost inevitably mess up in alternatives - and vice versa. We never starkly fail at life itself. When we mess up in worldly areas and feel dejected and isolated, the universe is just giving us an exceptional chance to begin the training which means we will one day become star athletes in other less well-known but hugely important races - races around keeping a sense of humour, showing gratitude, forgiving, appreciating, letting go - and making do. These are the noble tracks on which those who have 'failed' can finally, properly and redemptively learn to 'win.'"

    "Title": "What Everyone Really Wants",
    "Transcript": "We're often in situations of wanting to help and be kind to others, but of not knowing quite what they might be in need of. We'd like to deepen our connection to them and be of service, and yet lack a real grasp of what we could plausibly offer them; their minds seem impenetrable, their problems opaque. At such moments, we would do well to remember that we all possess a superpower, a capacity to give people something we can be sure they fundamentally require, founded on a primordial and basic insight into human nature: that all of us are in deep need of reassurance. Life is a more or less ongoing emergency for everyone. We are invariably haunted by doubts about our value, by concerns for our future, by shapeless anxiety and dread about things we've done, by feelings of guilt and embarrassment about ourselves. Everyday brings new threats to our integrity and except for very rare moments when we and the world feel solid, there is almost always a background throb of unwellness in our minds. It doesn't matter whether they are old or young, accomplished or starting out, at the top of the tree or struggling to get by, we can count on one thing about anyone we meet: they'll be beset by a sense of insecurity and, beneath some excellent camouflage, to a greater or lesser extent, of desperation. That means that, more than they perhaps even realise, they'll be longing for someone to say something soothing to them, a word or two to make them feel that they have a right to exist, that we have some faith in them, that we know things aren't always easy for them and that – in a vague but real way – we're on their side. It could be a very small, and barely perceptible remark, but it's effect might be critical: that something fascinating they said sticks in our minds, that we know the past few months might not have been simple for them, that we've found ourselves thinking of them since our last meeting, that we've noticed and admire the way they go about things, that they deserve a break and are, we can see, carrying so much. It's easy to mistake the work of reassurance with flattery. But flattery involves a lie to gain advantage, whereas reassurance involves revealing genuine affection – which we normally leave out from embarrassment – in order to bolster someone's ability to endure. We flatter in order to extract benefit, we reassure in order to help. Furthermore, the flatterer tells their prey about their strengths; the reassurer does something infinitely more valuable: they hint that they have seen the weaknesses, but have only tolerance and compassion for them on the basis of sharing fully in comparable ones themselves. 'I think you're going to be fine'; 'everyone goes through things like these' 'you have nothing to be ashamed of…' The words we need to say to reassure aren't new, they can be the most apparently banal of sentences, but we need to keep hearing them because our minds are extremely bad at holding on to their nourishing truths. They are, furthermore, lines that are a great deal more valuable and inclined to stick if someone else addresses them to us than if we try to rehearse them by ourselves. In 1425, the Florentine artist Masaccio painted a rendition of Adam and Eve's expulsion from the Garden of Eden on the walls of Florence's Church of Santa Maria del Carmine. We need not believe in any of the supernatural aspects of Genesis to be profoundly moved by the horror stricken faces of the banished couple. And if we are so, it is because what we see is a version of an agony that is essentially universal – for all of us have effectively been cast out of the realm of comfort and plenty and obliged to dwell in the lands of uncertainty, humiliation and grief. All of us are beset by woes, all of us are worried to the core, longing for rest and in urgent need of forbearance and gentleness. Part of the responsibility of living in a time that broadly no longer believes in divine reassurance is that we are each of us given a role to play in delivering part of that reassurance ourselves, to our fellow sufferers, in ordinary moments of our ordinary lives. We cannot generally know the precise details of other people's travails, but we can always be sure of a few vital things from the outset: that they are at some level in a mood of pain and self-suspicion, that certain very big things will not have gone right, that there will be intensities of loneliness, anxiety and shame at play, and that it could hence make a very big difference indeed if we were able to say something, however modest and even unoriginal, to bring a little reassurance into their day.

    "Title": "The Three Requirements of a Good Relationship",
    "Transcript": "Many people, after they've been in a couple for some time, will privately admit that they are - in many ways - frustrated and disappointed by the person they've chosen to share their lives with. If pressed for details, they will have no difficulty coming up with a list: their partner, they might complain: Is too loyal to their irritating family doesn't share their views on the layout of the living room Never wants to go on camping holidays Plays tennis every Wednesday evening, no matter what Doesn't like Moroccan food Doesn't share their enthusiasm for 19th century Russian novels Has a habit of adding 'actually' to every second sentence, when it's actually redundant As the list gets longer, they sigh; they still love their partner and long to be happy together, it's just that it seems impossibly complicated to make this relationship work. What's driving the frustration isn't that they've sadly fallen for an idiot as a mate; it's rather that we have all inherited needlessly complicated ideas of what a relationship is supposed to be for. We are told that love is meant to involve the almost total merger of two lives: we expect that a loving couple must live in the same house, eat the same meals together every night, share the same bed, go to sleep and get up at the same time; only ever have sex with (or even sexual thoughts about) each other, regularly see each others' families, have all their friends in common - and pretty much think the same thoughts on every topic at every moment. It's a beautiful vision, but a hellish one too, for it places an impossibly punitive burden of expectation on another human. We feel the partner must be right for us in every way, and if they're not, has to be prodded and cajoled into reform. But there's another perspective: relationships don't have to be so complicated and ambitious if we keep in view what in the end actually makes them fulfilling. If we boil matters down, there might really just be three essential things we want from one another: Kindness: a partner who is gentle with our imperfections and can good-humouredly tolerate us as we are. Shared vulnerability: someone with whom we can be open about our anxieties, worries and the problems that throw us off balance: someone we don't have to put on a good front for; someone around whom we can be weak, vulnerable and honest - and who will be the same around us. Understanding: someone who is interested in, and can make sense of, certain obscure features of our minds: our obsessions, preoccupations and ways of seeing the world. And whom we are excited to understand in turn. If we have these three critical ingredients to hand, we will feel loved and essentially satisfied whatever differences then crop up in a hundred other areas. Perhaps our partner's friends or routines won't be a delight, but we will be content. Just as if we lack these emotional goods, and yet agree on every detail of European literature, interior design and social existence, we are still likely to feel lonely and bereft. By limiting what we expect a relationship to be about, we can overcome the tyranny and bad temper that bedevils so many lovers. A good, simpler - yet very fulfilling - relationship could end up in a minimal state: we might not socialise much together. We might hardly ever encounter each other's families. Our finances might overlap only at a few points. We could be living in different places and only meet up twice a week. Conceivably we might not even ask too many questions about each other's sex life. But when we would be together it would be profoundly gratifying, because we would be in the presence of someone who knew how to be kind, vulnerable and understanding. A bond between two people can be deep and important precisely because it is not played out across all practical details of existence. By simplifying - and clarifying - what a relationship is for we release ourselves from overly complicated conflicts - and can focus on our urgent underlying needs to be sympathised with, seen and understood."

    "Title": "Why We Love to Suffer",
    "Transcript": "Without quite realising it, many of us are masochists.. The word derives, somewhat unfairly for him and his family, from the Austrian 19th century aristocrat and writer, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. As a young man, Leopold made a conventional marriage to a fellow member of the nobility, Aurora von Rümelin, but he swiftly discovered that his sexual tastes could not be accommodated within the relationship. When he was contacted by an admiring reader, a Baroness Fanny Pistor, under the ostensible excuse of seeking help with her writing style, he was able to discover a whole new side to his sexual identity. What he wanted most of all was that Fanny would dress in a grand and imperious-looking fur coat, flog him, dominate him and treat him with haughty cruelty. He wanted Fanny to call him 'Gregor', at that time a popular servant's name - and when they travelled, despite being far wealthier than her, insisted on being forced to sit in third class while she took her place in first. Leopold's proclivities, which he wrote up in a lightly disguised novella called Venus in Furs, caught the interests of the Austrian psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing, who (despite Leopold's family's protestations) included them in his landmark compendium of kinks, Psychopathology of Sex published in 1890 - which introduced the world to the term 'masochist': a person sexually aroused by being on the receiving end of pain. We now understand a sexual masochist as somebody who might want to be called obscenities, have their hair pulled or their skin scratched or ordered to describe themselves in highly derogatory and humiliating terms - albeit, it must be stressed, with explicit consent, for anything else would be merely abusive. The mystery is why this could prove so appealing and at points so necessary - to which psychotherapy has a powerful answer. For the masochist, cruel treatment in sex play is experienced, first and foremost, as a relief - a relief from the inauthenticity and alienating sentimentality that can otherwise flow from being treated with generous respect. Masochists tend not to think too highly of themselves; if others insist on handling them with kid gloves, they cannot feel seen and understood. It only starts to seem properly real and hence properly exciting when a special partner spots the very deep secret about them: that they are (at least for a time and in a certain way) a stupid idiot who deserves a severe beating. Though the phenomenon of masochism began with, and has remained most fully connected up to sex, it exists no less powerfully in the emotional realm. There may indeed be many more emotional masochists at large than there are sexual ones. As with sexual masochism, emotional masochism is rooted in self-suspicion. Emotional masochists do not deep down feel as if they are entirely loveable people worthy of careful appreciation and kindness. If someone treats them well in love, an emotional masochist would soon enough need to dismiss them as needy and deluded. Why - after all - would anyone feel better about them than they feel about themselves? In order to stop being an emotional masochist, it is vital to start to imagine that one might be one; to start to see - perhaps for the first time - the ways in which one is engaged in self-sabotage and has made an unconscious commitment to loneliness and frustration. The task is also to see that the origins of all this lie, as ever, in early life, where the masochist is liable to have relied on the affections of a parental figure who exhibited, alongside love, a high degree of cruelty, neglect or violence - leading the child to a conviction that their destiny must lie in suffering rather than fulfilment. The most relevant difference between sexual and emotional masochism is that the former activity will, in the right circumstances, be a lot of fun, whereas the latter one is never anything other than slow bitter hell. We owe it to ourselves to start to see the myriad of ways in which we may for far too long have been holding ourselves back from healthy relationships, not out of any kink or necessity, just because our past has unfairly imbued us with a sense that unfeeling treatment is all we deserve."

    "Title": "The Secrets of EMDR Therapy and How It Can Help You",
    "Transcript": "The fundamental idea behind psychotherapy is that we tend to grow mentally unwell because we haven't been able to think with sufficient clarity about the difficulties in our past, typically in our distant childhoods. Damaging incidents have been locked away, and continue to have an outsized impact on us, but we have no way of going back over them in order to liberate ourselves from their distorting influences. At the dawn of therapy, Sigmund Freud noticed that many patients, when asked about their childhoods, provided accounts that were too neat, too intellectual, too distanced from the emotion contained in events to be of any use. In order to encourage more real feeling, he made a radical innovation: he asked if his patients might lie on a couch, shut their eyes and enter a dreamy state that he called 'free association'. He soon found that these patients recovered far faster than those who insisted on sitting in chairs. As a result, there are now couches in therapy rooms around the world – and the past has for many of us been a lot easier to access. Then, in the early 1990s, an American psychologist called Francine Shapiro became fascinated, as Freud had been, with the damage done in therapy by our tendencies to intellectualise the past rather than re-live it. Not coincidentally, Shapiro was at work on a PhD in English literature which drew her attention to a key difference between the methods of the non-fiction essay and those of the novel. In the former, an author provides neat summaries of positions and emotions: they might tell us that their mother was often 'sad' and their father 'frightening'. But novelists do something very different, they provide us with 'scenes': they don't state, they show. They take us to a particular moment and let us experience it vividly through our senses. With this distinction in mind, Shapiro wondered if patients in therapy could become more like novelists of their childhoods rather than just their non-fiction narrators. And it was here that she stumbled on a remarkable phenomenon. When we are asked to perform a repetitive movement – like tapping gently on our knees or our chests from left to right or look at a finger moving from side to side a few inches from our eyes – then our ordinary practical day to day mentality often cedes to a more trance-like, speculative state of consciousness (something similar can occur when we are on a long train journey in a quiet carriage and follow a line of telephone poles flashing past us). In this state, if we are asked to think back to a scene in our past, we may remember an emotional texture that would previously have eluded us; we become more like novelists than essayists. This special state became the bedrock of what Shapiro termed EMDR therapy (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy). The EMDR therapist, entirely loyal to Freud's basic insight about the need to bring traumatic scenes back to conscious awareness, invites patients to return to key scenes that make them who they now are, often scenes of great difficulty: their first night at boarding school, the day their mother told them about the divorce, the moment they were humiliated by a stranger. They are helped to linger in the past, to experience it in all its dimensions. The patient might cry in a way they haven't in years – if ever. But the idea is not to abandon a younger self in one of the most difficult moments of their lives, it's to help them find a way out of their pain. So an EMDR therapist might, after a time back in a foundational 'scene', ask the patient what they might want to tell their younger self; they might want to comfort them, to encourage them to be angry, to help them stop taking all the blame. Before initiating a session of time travel, the EMDR therapist will also ask a patient to identify both someone who gives them support and someone who is wise. These two characters will then be asked to enter an early traumatic scene to give it a new, more redemptive ending. A current loving partner might be asked to comfort a child-self; Winnicott, the Buddha or Plato might say a few words to an angry father or weeping mother. In this way, EMDR honours the traditional ambitions of therapy: it renders conscious feelings that had been shut away, and it liberates us from the influence of the past through a deeper understanding of its secrets. But it has the added advantage of allowing us to reconnect with our histories via sensorily-rich scenes rather than analytical summaries. In this way, the world can become less oppressive and fear laden, as our formative moments are unearthed, understood and properly laid to rest. \"Psychotherapy\" is a set of 20 beautiful cards, each containing a short essay on a key concept in psychotherapy; creating a pack that offers a perfect introduction to the concept."

    "Title": "The Secret of Successful Relationships:  Rupture and Repair",
    "Transcript": "Many tensions within relationships can usefully be looked at through the prism of a concept much used within psychotherapy: the idea of 'rupture' and 'repair.' For psychotherapists, every relationship is at risk of moments of frustration or as the term has it, of 'rupture', when we suffer a loss of trust in another person as someone in whom we can safely deposit our love, and whom we believe can be kind and understanding of our needs. The ruptures are often quite small, and to outside observers perhaps imperceptible: one person fails to respond warmly to another's greeting; someone tries to explain an idea to their partner who shrugs and says off-handedly that they have no idea what they're on about; in front of friends, a lover shares an anecdote which casts the partner in a less than flattering light. Or the rupture can be more serious: someone calls someone a stupid fool and breaks a door. A birthday is forgotten. An affair begins. The point about ruptures is that they say nothing – in themselves – about a relationship's prospects of survival. There might be constant rather grave ruptures and no break up. Or there might be one or two tense moments over a minor disagreement – and things head towards collapse. What determines the difference is something that psychotherapists are especially keen to teach us about: the capacity for what they term 'repair'. Repair refers to the work needed for two people to regain each others' trust, and restore themselves in the others' mind as someone who is essentially decent and sympathetic and can be a 'good enough' interpreter of their needs. As psychotherapy points out, repair isn't just one capacity among others, it is arguably the central determinant of one's mastery of emotional maturity; it is what identifies us as true adults. Good repair relies on at least four separate skills: 1. The Ability to Apologise A sorry may not be as easy as it sounds, for it isn't just a few warm words one has to say, the true cost is to one's self-love. If one is already on the verge of finding oneself somewhat intolerable, then the call to concede yet another point – to own up to being still more foolish, emotionally unbalanced, controlling, hot-tempered or vain – can feel like a demand too far. We may opt to dig in and avoid a sorry not because we are overly pleased with ourselves but precisely because our unworthiness feels so painfully obvious to us already – and lends us no faith to imagine that any apologies we did make could arouse the kind of forebearance and kindness we crave – and yet so badly feel we don't deserve. 2. The Ability to Forgive There can be equal difficulty around being able to accept an apology. To do so requires us to extend imaginative sympathy for why good people (which includes us) can end up doing some pretty bad things – not because they are 'evil' but because they are in their varied ways tired or sad, worried or weak. A forgiving outlook lends us energy to look around for the most generous reasons why fundamentally decent people can at points behave less than optimally. When this kind of forgiveness feels impossible, therapists speak of a manoeuvre of the mind known as 'splitting', a tendency to declare some people to be entirely good and others, just as simply, entirely awful. In dividing humanity like this, we protect ourselves from what can feel like the impossible dangers of disappointment or grown-up ambivalence. Either someone is pure and perfect and we can love them without reserve or – quite suddenly – they must be appalling and we can never ever forgive them. We cling to rupture because it confirms a story which, though deeply sad at one level, also feels very safe: that big emotional commitments are invariably too risky, that others can't be trusted, that hope is an illusion – and that we are basically all alone. 3. The Ability to Teach Behind a rupture, there often lies a failed attempt by one person to teach something to another. There was something that they were trying to get across when they lost their temper or got into a sulk: something about how to behave around a parent or what to do about sex, how to approach childcare or how to handle money. And yet the effort went wrong and they forgot all about the art of good teaching, an art which relies, to a surprising extent, on a degree pessimism about the ability of another person to understand what we want from them. Good teachers aren't after miraculous outcomes. They know how resistant the human mind can be to new ideas. They swallow a very large dose of pessimism about successful interpersonal communication in order to stay calm and in a good mood around the inevitable frustrations of relationships. They don't shout because they didn't from the outset allow themselves to believe in total symmetries of mind. When they're trying to get something across, they don't push a point too hard. They give their listener time and know about defensiveness – and as a fallback, accept that they may have to respect two different realities. They can in the end bear to accept that they will always be a bit misunderstood even by someone who loves them very much. 4. The Ability to Learn It can feel so much easier to get offended with someone than to dare to imagine they might have something important to tell us. We may prefer to get hung up about how they informed us of an idea rather than address the substance of what they are trying to convey. It isn't easy to have to imagine that we are still beginners in a range of areas. The good repairer is ultimately a good learner: they have a lively and non-humiliating sense of how much they still have left to take on board. It isn't a surprise or a cause for alarm that someone might level a criticism at them. It's merely a sign that a kindly soul is invested enough in their development to notice areas of immaturity – and, in the safety of a relationship, to offer them something almost no one otherwise ever bothers with: feedback. In the Japanese tradition of kintsugi, broken pots and vases are artfully mended using a gold inflected lacker and displayed as precious works of art, as a way to emphasise the dignity and basic human importance of the art of repair. We should do something of the same with our love stories. It is a fine thing to have a relationship without moments of rupture no doubt, but it is a finer and more noble achievement still to know how to patch things up repeatedly with those precious strands of emotional gold: self-acceptance, patience, humility, courage and a lot of tenderness."

    "Title": "How to Get Out of a Despairing Mood",
    "Transcript": "It may sound strange to locate the problem here, but in some of our most despairing moods, what goes wrong is our power of imagination. We are not merely 'sad'; we cannot imagine any better life than the agonised one we currently have. What we really mean by imagination is the power to summon up alternatives. When we are down, we can't imagine finding another job or not minding what the gossip says about us. We can't imagine finding another partner or letting ourselves trust someone again. But on the other hand with sufficient imagination, almost any problem can be worked around. If one door has closed, the imagination should in time be able to find another. There are other cities we can go to, there are completely new sorts of work we could try. There are places we can travel where no one knows who we are. There are lovers who will have a very different approach to intimacy than those we have known to date. The oceans are so large and beautifully unconcerned with us. We are grown-ups, that is, people with choices. We are not the small children we once were who had to depend on their parents for everything and were imprisoned by narrow circumstances. We would be able to build ourselves a small hut on the edge of the desert. We can change our names. If we're feeling shy and defeated, we don't have to go out and see anyone ever again. We can live by ourselves, mind our own business. We can go mad for a while and then recover; a lot of people do. We could throw ourselves into learning a new language or take a university degree in Sanskrit by correspondence course. We can find the love we need; we only require two friends, or even just one, to get by. Many people might be cruel, but a few are infinitely compassionate and kind and we can go out and find them and not let them go. We don't have to stick by the script we thought we'd be following all our lives. We might have wanted to do so – but we are profoundly flexible creatures. When we arrived on the earth, our mental wiring was loose enough that we could have developed into excellent foragers in the Kalahari desert, Latin scholars in a university or accountants in the logistics industry. Our biology is elastic. We may have lost a little of that primordial flexibility and latitude, it might no longer be so easy to pick up new languages or physical moves, but we remain eminently equipped to acquire new tricks. Other people – noble and interesting other people – have been here before us. There have been exiled Russian princes who learnt how to become tennis teachers, émigré South Vietnamese army generals who started American kindergartens; divorcees who remarried; shamed executives who opened corner shops. In order to increase our chances of fulfilment, we need to feed and massage our imaginations. Whatever way we happen to be living, we should constantly force ourselves to picture different, more arduous but still bearable ways to be. We could think about how we might survive without any friends, without a reputation, without health, without any love, without much money. As part of their creative writing classes, adolescents should be asked to produce narratives titled: If I lost everything and had to start up again, I might… They could be asked to make a list of the 20 things that currently make life meaningful; then have to cross them all off and find 10 more. Only a few of us will ever need to write short stories for a living, very many of us will be called upon by fate to rewrite the stories of our lives. That is the true destiny and function of the imagination. When we are very sad, we should be provoked by the intellectual puzzle before us: How else might we get by, given how many possibilities have been closed to us? How could we fertilise the dung heap we are on? Our challenge is to learn to rebuild our futures intelligently and creatively on the ruins of our old lives."

    "Title": "The Need to Be Honest at the Start of Relationships",
    "Transcript": "A powerful instinct when we meet someone we're attracted to is to try to please them - and we can naturally assume that the best way we might do this is to signal just how much we agree with their views and choices on all matters great and small. On an early date, when they happen to mention that they love dancing, we will reveal that of course we love dancing too. Or when they explain how boring they find museums, we will hide that on a trip to Berlin last year, we spent a whole fascinating day in the galleries of the Altes Museum. We may not state direct falsehoods but we stretch and bend the truth to its limits so as to create an impression of near-total alignment. Along the way, it rarely occurs to us that they might be performing some of the same rigmarole for us, that they might also be adjusting their self-presentation in subtle but powerful ways to fit in with what they take to be our preferences and values. There's a tragi-comic aspect to our deepening mutual attraction. Two decent people are trying to be as nice as they can. No one is setting out to deceive and yet, gradually, a set of hugely misleading and dangerous ideas about who each person really is, are getting established. The apparent success of our will-to-please can inspire us to move in together and later to marry. And then - inevitably - the prolonged, intimate scrutiny that coupledom brings reveals the scale of our mistaken expectations. In a sequence of disillusioning stages, we are each saddened, disappointed and shocked to discover who we have ended up with. There are recriminations, rows and fragile reconciliations until finally one or other of us comes to the grim, but still surprising conclusion that we were never compatible. Or we may stick at it with growing misery. We face a life-time of holidays that never involve the museum visits we crave. We have to resign ourselves to never having had the kind of sex we want. Or, even more grievously, we eventually embark on a furtive life; we seek out the moments when they're away to pursue needs we've pretended not to have. Until one day our double-life is exposed - and we drown in bitterness, fury and sorrow. Yet the origin of such nightmares is only ever a hugely touching, but painfully flawed and risky, devotion to being an easy match. We want to be simple; and yet we end up in a very complicated mess. A genuinely simpler approach would involve daring to be a bit more complex from the start. There is no need to be brazen or demanding just as there is no requirement that our date agree or even stick around beyond dessert (or the main course). Some will run away - and should. It will save everyone a lot of time. In order to be honest in seduction, we need a basic sense of acceptability, we must know that we are not perfect but that we are not for that matter wholly abject or shameful. Our inner conviction that our oddities are essentially reasonable allows us to present ourselves to another person without fear or defensiveness. Our candour then arms us with the right to ask our date to reveal - with similar honesty - what may be individual and difficult about their own characters. If they insist that they are really very simple and 'easy', we are allowed to be gently but firmly sceptical. They are a human being, and to be human is to be complicated. It cannot possibly be true that they exist without significant quirks. Being straightforward on dates is in the end a mechanism for two people to fast-forward time - and to spare themselves agony. We should know that a polished surface can't be a true picture of who anyone can be. Only once our mutual complexities have been outlined should we sense that we are safe in the presence of a fellow mature and pleasingly direct individual. We will have the simpler relationships we desire, when we can dare to share and accommodate the actual complexities of human nature."

    "Title": "On Feeling Stuck",
    "Transcript": "Many of us spend a large a part of our lives, in one way or another, feeling stuck, that is in a state where a strong desire to move forward on an issue meets with an equally strong compulsion to stay fixed where one is. For example, we might at one level powerfully want to leave a job in finance in order to retrain in architecture – but at the same time, remain blocked by a range of doubts, hesitations, counter-arguments and guilty feelings. Or we might be impelled to leave our marriage – while simultaneously unable to imagine any realistic life outside it. To act feels horrific, but doing nothing is killing us as well. Every avenue appears shut off. And so one ruminates, turns over the question late at night, tries the patience of therapists – and watches life go by with mounting anxiety and self-disgust. As an outsider, one might be tempted to ask questions to move things on: Why don't you try to enrol on a course to see if you might like a new area of work? Why don't you discuss your dissatisfactions with your partner? Why don't you go to counselling? What about splitting up? But we're likely to find that our friend can't make any progress, whatever we say. It seems as if they are subject to a law disbarring them from progressing, not a law you'd find in the statutes of the country they live in, but some sort of personal law – a law that might go like this: Make sure you don't achieve satisfaction in your career; Make sure your relationship has no life in it but cannot be abandoned; Make sure you aren't happy in the place you live in. In order to understand the origin of these laws, we have to look backwards. Difficult childhoods and the complicated families they unfold in are the originators of a lot of these restrictive unspoken laws, whose impact echoes across our lives. Some of these laws might go like this: 'Make sure you never shine, it would upset your little sister'. 'You have to be cheerful not to let my depression break through.' 'Never be creatively fulfilled because it would remind me of my envy'; 'Reassure us that we are clever by winning all the prizes at school'; 'We need you to achieve to make us feel OK about ourselves'. 'You would disappoint me if you became boisterous and one day sexual'. Of course, no one ever directly says such things in a family (laws couldn't operate if they could so easily be seen), but the laws are there nevertheless, holding us into a particular position as we grow up and then, once we have left home, continuing to surreptitiously distort our personalities away from the path of their legitimate growth. It can be hard to draw any connection between adult stuck situations and any childhood laws. We may miss the link between our reluctance to act at work and a situation with dad at home thirty years before. But we can hazard a principle nevertheless: any long-term stuckness is likely to be the result of butting into some sort of law inherited unknowingly from childhood. We are stuck because we are being overly loyal to an idea of something being impossible generated in the distant past, impossible because it was threatening to someone we cared for or depended on. Therefore one of the main paths to liberation lies in coming to 'see' that the law exists and then unpicking its warped and unnecessary logic. We can start by asking whether, beneath our practical dilemma, there may be a childhood law at work, encouraging us to stay where we are. We can dig beneath the surface problem in search of the emotional structure that might be being engaged (in the unconscious, architecture = the creativity dad never enjoyed, sexual fulfilment = what hurt my loveable mum). We may discover that some of the reason we can't give up on finance and take up a more imaginative role is because throughout childhood, we had to accept a law that we couldn't be both creatively fulfilled and make money – in order to protect our volatile father from his own envy and inadequacy. Or we can't leave our marriage because, unconsciously, we're coming up against a law from childhood that tells us that being a good child means renouncing one's more bodily and visceral sides. The specifics will differ but the principle of a hidden law from childhood explains a huge number of adult stucknesses. The way forward is, first and foremost, hence to realise that there might be a law in operation when we get stuck, that we aren't merely being cowardly or slow in not progressing; and that we feel trapped because we are, in our faulty minds, back in a cage formed in childhood, which we have to be able to see, think about and then patiently dismantle. We can along the way accept that we are now adults, which means that the original family drama no longer has to apply. We don't have to worry about upsetting parental figures; their taboos were set up to protect them but they are making us ill; we can feel sad for the laws that these damaged figures imposed on us (often with no active malevolence) but can recognise that our imperative is move them aside and act with the emotional freedom that has always been our birthright. We may need to be disloyal to a way of being that protected someone we cared about or depended on – in order to be loyal to a more important someone still: ourselves.

    "Transcript": "For most of our lives, we're hard at work: we're up till midnight in the library studying for a degree, we're learning a trade, building a business, writing a book. We have hardly a moment to ourselves. We don't even ask whether we are fulfilled, it's simply obvious that this is the bit that has to hurt. We fall asleep counting the weeks until the end. And then, finally, one day, slightly unexpectedly, the end arrives. Through slow and steady toil, we have achieved what we had been seeking for years: the book is done, the business is sold, the degree certificate is on the wall. People around us cheer and lay on a party; we might even take a holiday. And that is when, for those of us in the melancholy camp, a supreme unease is liable to descend. The beach is beautiful, the sky is flawless, there is a scent of lemon in the air from the orchard. We have nothing unpleasant to do. We can read, loll, play and dawdle. Why then are we so flat, disoriented and perhaps slightly tearful? Why are we so scared? The mind works in deceptive ways. In order to generate the momentum required to induce us to finish any task, this mind pretends that once the work is done, it will finally be content, it will accept reality as it is. It will cease its restless, persecutory questions, it won't throw up random unease or guilty supposions. It will be on our side. But whether by intent or coincidence, our mind isn't in any way well suited to honouring such promises. It turns out to be vehemently opposed to, and endangered by, states of calm and relaxation. It can manage them, at best, for a day or so. And then, with cold rigour, it will be on its way again with worries and questions. It will ask us once more to account for ourselves, to ask what the point of us is, to doubt whether we are worthy or decent, to question what right we have to be. Once hard work ends, there is nothing to stop our melancholy minds from leading us to the edge of an abyss we had been able to resist so long as our heads were down. We start to feel that no achievement will ever in fact be enough, that nothing we do can last or make a difference, that little is as good as it should be, that we are tainted by a primordial guilt at being alive and a sense of not having paid our dues, that others around us are far more noble and able than we will ever be, that the blue sky is oppressive and frightening in its innocence – and that 'doing nothing' is the hardest thing we have ever attempted to do. It is as though deep down, the melancholy mind knows that the ultimate fate of the planet is to be absorbed by the sun in seven and a half billion years and that everything is therefore vain and futile against a cosmological sense of time and space. We know that we are puny and irrelevant apparitions; we haven't been so much busy as protected from despair by the use of deadlines, punishing schedules, work trips and late night conference calls. But now, with the achievement secured, there is no defence left against the might of existential terror. It is just us and, in the firmament above, the light of a billion billion dying stars. There are no more 8.30am meetings, no more revision notes, no more chapter deadlines to distract us from our metaphysical irrelevance. We should be kinder on ourselves. Rather than putting ourselves through the infinitely demanding process of idling (as though a nervous, adrenaline we should be self-compassionate enough to keep setting ourselves one slightly irrelevant but well camouflaged challenge after another – and do our very best to pretend that these matter inordinately and that there should be no sizeable gaps between them. Our work exists to protect us from a brutal sense of despair and angst. We should make sure we never stop having tasks to do – and never make that most reckless of all moves, 'retire' or embark on that next most reckless step, taking a long holiday. How to think more effectively is a book about how to optimize our minds  so that they can more regularly and generously produce the short of insights and ideas we need to fulfill our potential and achieve the contentment we deserve."

the brilliant romantic artist who a few years before had won international renown for his raft of the medusa is shown stretched out on his bed in his parisian studio in the redemption having just succumbed to a typhoid infection developed after a riding accident he was 33 years old given the extent of their contributions it seems appalling how young these talents died but when we zero in on the oft remarked detail that they seem to have achieved more in a few brief years than many of us achieve in eight decades a new thought opens up the very discrepancy between us and them suggests that we are perhaps being overly blunt when we choose to measure lifespan in a unitary way without reference to what someone happens to be doing with the years that they've been allotted a year in the hands of a person who is open to experience who creates feels loves connects and delights is a lot denser and in that way therefore longer than exactly the same amount of time in the hands of a less responsive and less inwardly generous human being we might go so far as to propose that a year in the life of the former should be given a different numerical weight than one in the latter that a year in the life of say jericho or emily bronte should not be counted in exactly the same way as a year for someone else and might more rightly be doubled or more we know in travel that two days in a particularly vibrant city can feel like a year in another less inspired place and the same is true of life more broadly not everyone who is living is equally alive just as we calculate dog years to take animal size and anatomy into account so we might recalibrate lifespan according to the depths of meaning one has plumbed not the gross years that one has breathed adjusted for the intensity of experience we might hence judge that whatever basic chronology might claim mozart really died at around 120 years old and sylvia plath at 80 and jericho in his mid-70s all this matters immensely because our sadness at the idea of death frequently reduces itself to the thought that our lives might not be as we put it long enough but we shouldn't measure a life by the hours it contains rather by the wisdom love and intelligence with which these hours have been spent by which school many of the people most legendary for having had brief lives really had nothing of the sort it doesn't matter in this if we have no genius level capacities at poetry or painting it still remains for us to choose how purposefully and beautifully and therefore ultimately how long we can live we should not stay transfixed or devastated by the simple number of days liable to be ahead of us we should concentrate on how to sprinkle them with meaning in the novel the leopard by giuseppe tomasi de la pedusa there's a powerful death scene the elderly fabrizio corbeira prince of selena who is the psychological center of the book is about to die he's lying in bed with his weeping relatives around him and he asks himself the terrifying fundamental question how much of my life have i actually lived the answer is deeply disturbing he can pick out a few months here and there two weeks before his wedding two weeks after a few days around the birth of his first son certain hours he spent in his observatory he's a distinguished astronomer a few hours of flirtation here and there times when he was reading aloud to his children conversations with one or two friends particularly his nephew but not much in total perhaps a year or two out of 70. if we measure the reality of our lives by the quantity of time we have passed in a state of genuine happiness the answer may be distressing but it might be the right way of sizing up the length of a life we should become far more focused on how well we live rather than the absolute number of days we're going to exist we're not in the end ever really very short of time what we're truly short of is affection open-heartedness kindness tolerance we're short of the ability to create peak experiences in which we are sufficiently unfrightened approachable and responsive we may have a lot to mourn but it isn't necessarily the imminence of death it may more be the difficulty of living with courage and sensitivity the challenge of our lives is to learn to live deeply rather than extensively the artist john isaacs depicts a ravaged corpse in a gallery its stomach hangs out its rib cage appears to have been hacked at like a butcher's carcass but the real horror and rebuke lies in the title of the work are you still mad at me the tone is calculatedly banal next to the ghoulish fate that has befallen what we take to be someone's erstwhile partner the poor corpse before us might only a little while ago have spent their time in an apartment squabbling with their loved one asserting their point of view not forgiving not being able to move on sure they were right but not being able to see things through another's eyes and now their pettiness is being judged from the perspective of death are we really going to spend the only lives we'll ever know in yet another argument about who disrespected whom when outside the narrow chasm of our embittered relationships so many opportunities for joy and wonder remain are we going to walk towards death without properly filling our lungs with a beauty of existence we aren't here being warned that we're gonna die that's eminently survivable as a thought we're being warned of a far more appalling but less often mentioned danger that we might die in the midst of a sulk about not very

    "Title": "How to Learn to Love Oneself More",
    "Transcript": "Every day, especially in the era of social media (from the mental health perspective, probably the single worst invention of modern times), we are likely to face enemies. People who disagree with us, people who tell us we're 'bad', people who say we should be ashamed of ourselves - or even be destroyed. The common-sense advice, from well-meaning friends, is not to listen, to shrug it off, to assert that no one cares, that the bully is 'mad' or mentally unwell - and to suggest a change of scene. It's very kind - and, sadly, usually, for many of us, entirely ineffective. The question then emerges: why is it that some people find it extremely hard to defend themselves, either in the sense of practically answering back to an enemy or simply of not caving in internally in the face of an attack? Why is it that, when they are being bullied at work, some people are able to mount a polite, calm fightback, while others melt into self-loathing and despair? Why is it that if they are criticised unfairly in a romantic context, some people are able to point out that the criticism is not right and get their side of the story across and feel steady and solid, while others descend at once into paranoia? We might put it like this: in order to be able to defend oneself against an external foe, one has to be on one's own side. And this is not - for some of us - as easy as it sounds. Without us necessarily even quite realising the fact, our entire personalities may be geared towards interpreting ourselves as bad, wrong, a mistake, shameful and a piece of shit. This may sound dramatic and we know, in our intellectual adult selves, that this can't be entirely right. Nevertheless, deep down, this isn't only slightly right, it's the fundamental truth about us. A first step towards dealing with an external enemy is realising that our personalities are built up in such a way that we're going to have a big problem on our hands whenever we face opposition. We should expect to find this hard and we do. We are, and there is no pejorative association around this whatsoever, a bit mentally fragile or unwell in this area. We therefore need to call for help, extend a lot of compassion to ourselves and devote all the critical care we're going to need to get through the crisis. We then need to take on board that - unfortunately - the real enemy we're harbouring is not so much currently outside of us (though they are there too) as inside of us. We need to ask ourselves: why does the accusation feel so true? Our conscious minds give us access to only a fraction of the information about us. Just as we can't intuitively understand how a cell operates in our very own body, so the make up of most of our emotional brain is sunk in darkness. However, there will be a history to our self-loathing. We hate ourselves because somewhere along the line, we were not properly loved. Somewhere in the past, we heard a story - you are a piece of shit, you don't deserve to be, f*** off… - and the story has stuck. How could someone facing an accusation that they are an idiot but who inside has a voice saying that they're a moron ever get the strength to defend themselves? They know in the adult part of the mind that they should be fighting back, but they can't, because inside all they hear is: you are everything your enemy is saying you are. They identify entirely with their aggressor. This can get pretty dangerous pretty fast. If the external enemy is vicious enough, and joins artfully enough with the internal enemy, there can be suicidal thoughts - and perhaps suicide itself. The defenceless are the opposite of self-righteous. To their enemies, they are implicitly saying: I hate myself more than you ever could. I want to kill myself more than you want to kill me. The solution to this is a large naive word we'll have heard before but which we need to grasp in its life-saving dimension: love. We need to hear often enough and clearly enough from other human beings - and they don't need to be romantic partners - that contrary to what the internal enemy is saying, we are decent enough, not perfect but that isn't the criterion for deserving to exist. We need to fix ourselves by absorbing, properly absorbing, the kindness of others. The problem is that people who feel they are pieces of shit aren't very good at letting others take care of them. They don't know how to ask for help, and when help is given, they may initially push it away, accusing the kind friend of being weird or inadequate (why would they be seeking to help a freak?). We know from the condition known as body dysmorphia that it's no use telling someone who feels they are disgusting that they are in fact very nice looking. We need to help them understand how they grew to hate themselves so much and show them, via a friendship, that there could be another way of relating to who they are. We have some hints about how our minds work from the way we acquire language: children fluently pick up incredibly complex patterns of speech from listening to those around them in the early years. A parallel emotional process is going on. If someone when we were little was speaking hate, and shame and guilt to us, we will have started to speak like that to ourselves - and it won't be easy, in adulthood, to learn a new language, let alone to come to speak it fluently to ourselves. Telling someone mired in self-hatred to 'cheer up' or 'like themselves a bit more' is going to be as impatient as telling someone from England to 'just speak Bulgarian'. It's going to take time and a lot of training. Nevertheless, if we want to think about what an ambitious project for humanity would look like, it would be a giant programme of learning to replace the internalised languages of hate and enmity with those of love and compassion. We've trying to do this for a couple of millenia at least. But we've done a pretty poor job of it so far - and the project feels more urgent than ever. We might start today, by speaking a few stumbling phrases of love to the self-hating part of ourselves and to someone we know near us who is perhaps right now mired in shame and inadequacy. At The School of Life we run regular virtual classes for adults.  These mini life courses cover such topics as; how to help relationships work, coping with anger and anxiety, career guidance, finding meaning and purpose in life and using culture as a therapeutic tool."

    "Title": "5 Reasons the Modern World Is so Ugly",
    "Transcript": "One of the great generalisations we can make about the modern world is that it is, to an extraordinary degree, an ugly world. If we were to show an ancestor from 250 years ago around our cities and suburbs, they would be amazed at our technology and wealth - but shocked by what we had built. Why are things so ugly. There are at least five reasons i: The War on 'Beauty' Since the dawn of construction, it was understood that the task of an architect was not only to make a building serviceable, but also to render it beautiful. Even if the building was a practical one, like an aqueduct or a factory, architects would strive to give it a maximally pleasing appearance. The Romans understood that a water pumping system might be as beautiful as a temple, the early Victorians felt that even a factory could have some of the aesthetic properties of an elegant country house, the Milanese knew that a shopping arcade could carry some of the ambitions of a cathedral. But when architecture reached modern times, the very word beauty became taboo. The architects of the modern movement began to wage a war on what they now described as the effeminacy, wastefulness and pretention of all previous 'beautifying' moves. In an essay called 'Ornament and Crime' (1910) the Austrian modernist Adolf Loos argued that to decorate a building with anything 'pretty' was a sin against the true profession of the architect - which he now redefined in purely functional terms. As Modernism declared: 'Form must follow function' - in other words, the appearance of a building should never be shaped by a consideration for beauty; all that should matter is the basic material purpose. At the outset, this seemed bracing - but liberating. The 19th century had produced some very over-decorated buildings, in which the beautifying impulse had reached a decadent stage. At the same time, many early modernist buildings - especially those for wealthy clients - were extremely elegant in a way that felt novel and cleansing. Unfortunately, the dream quickly turned sour. When property developers heard that the artistic avant-garde was now promoting a concept of functionalism, they rejoiced. From the most high brow quarters, the most mean minded motives had been given a seal of approval. No longer would these developers have to spend any money on anything to do with beauty. In no time, sheds and brutal boxes abounded. Modernity became ugly because we forgot how to articulate that beauty is, in the end, as much of a necessity for a building as a functioning roof. The ugliness of the modern world rests on a second intellectual error: the idea that no one knows what is attractive in architecture. In the premodern world, it was widely assumed that there were precise rules about what made buildings pleasing. In the West, those rules were codified in a doctrine known as 'Classicism.' Created by the Greeks and developed by the Romans, Classicism defined what elegant buildings should be like for more than a thousand five hundred years. Recognisably classical forms were present all over the West, from Edinburgh to Charleston, Bordeaux to San Francisco. Then gradually, a degree of polite disagreement broke out. Some people began to make a case for other styles, for example for the Gothic way of building or perhaps the Chinese, Alpine or Thai styles. A diversity In time, the debates were resolved in an intellectually extremely respectful way - that happened to provoke some very bad practical consequences. It was decreed that, in matters of visual taste, no one could really win the argument. All tastes deserved a hearing. There was no such thing as an objective standard. Attractiveness in architecture was evidently a multifaceted and subjective phenomenon. Once again, this was music to property developers' ears. Suddenly, no one would be allowed to describe a building as 'ugly'. After all, taste was merely subjective. You and your friends might dislike a new district, even a democratic majority might loathe it, but that was only a personal judgement, not some kind important edict one might need to listen to. Cities grew ever uglier, but no one was allowed even to say that there was such a thing as 'ugliness'. After all, isn't taste just a very very personal thing? iii. Originality For most of history, it was well understood that the last thing one needed in an architect was 'originality' - no more than one would want originality in a carpenter or a bricklayer. The job of an architect was just to turn out a building roughly like all the others. Architecture was beautifully impersonal and repetitive. But in the early 20th century, a troubling idea came to the fore: that the architect was a distinctive individual, with a unique vision, which needed to be expressed. This might have been a liberation for certain architects, but society as a whole paid an enormous collective price for this creative release. Suddenly, architects began to compete to create the most outlandish and shocking forms We lost our ability to say that what we really craved was buildings that looked a bit like they had always done; buildings that one wouldn't ever have to wonder who did them. iv. Sprawl For most of history, humans lived in tightly organised, neatly aligned streets and squares - not because anyone thought this was especially attractive (though it is), but because it was convenient. When you had to get around on foot or at best on horseback, it paid to keep things close together. Furthermore, it was safer, because invaders might attack at any time, and it was crucial to ring your town with a wall, adding further impetus to keep everything well arranged inside, like a compact cutlery drawer or toolkit. But without anyone quite noticing, with the spread of cars in the 1920s, the pressure to use space neatly evaporated. One could now lounge on the earth, or sprawl lazily across it. Highways could meander between towers, bits of scrubland and scatterings of warehouses. The nervous and precise among us who like things to be neatly lined up, who are disturbed when a picture is slightly askew or the knife and fork aren't equidistant from the plate, grew ever more sorrowful. v. Keeping it Local Architects had once had no option but to build in materials that were both natural and local. This had two advantages. Firstly, as a general rule, one cannot go very wrong with natural materials. You have to try very hard to make an ugly stone or wood building; it's difficult to build very high in them for a start, so your eyesore is guaranteed a certain modesty. And the inherent organic beauty of timber and limestone, granite or marble attenuates any errors at the level of form. Secondly, it can help to orient us and connect us to particular places if they don't look like they could be anywhere on earth, if Jerusalem is built in one sort of stone and Bath in another. But modernity introduced glass and steel, out of which large and imposing structures could quickly be formed, and it suggested that it would be as daft to have local architecture as it would be to have a local phone or bicycle design. The argument once again forgot about human nature. When we say that a building looks like it 'could be anywhere', we're not praising its global ambitions, we're expressing a longing for a building to remind us of where on earth we are. We pay dearly for bad architecture. A dumb book or song can be shelved and disturb no one. A dumb building will stand defacing the earth and upsetting all who must look at it for 300 years. Architecture is, on this basis alone, the most important of the arts, and (to enforce the problem further) the one we're never taught anything about all the way through school. The promise of modernity had been to make the most important things available cheaply to all: no longer would lovely food or clothes, holidays or medicines, be just the preserve of the rich. Industrial technology would open up quality for everyone. But paradoxically, one key ingredient we all long for has been rendered more exclusive than ever through our inability to think clearly. The one thing we can't appear to mass produce is beautiful architecture. As a result, the nice architecture there is, most of which was built before 1900, is hugely oversubscribed and collapsing under a weight of tourists - and the few pleasant streets that remain are costlier than they ever were at the height of the aristocratic age. We have democratised comfort, we have made beauty appallingly exclusive. The challenge is to remember our longing for beauty - and to fight the forces that would keep us from acting on it. Our book What is Culture for?  Helps us find compassion, hope and perspective in the arts."

    "Title": "HISTORY OF IDEAS - Loneliness",
    "Transcript": "When we think of what might have been lost on the way to becoming modern, we're liable to think about mealtimes: how seldom they now take place communally, how rare it is for whole families to gather, how much technology can intrude. In paintings of communal meals that reflect the older way of doing things, we can appreciate how all ages used to come together around a table and how welcoming the atmosphere seems to have been. Even the family horse might have been invited to join in. The modern condition appears so bleak by comparison. Rather than a family around the hearth, the emblematic image is of a single person with a tray on their trees in front of the television. It was the Swanson Corporation, originally a poultry producer in Omaha, Nebraska, that launched the frozen TV dinner in 1954, the same year colour television was introduced in the United States. It is a short distance in time, but a long way in spirit, from Norman Rockwell's laughter-filled family Thanksgiving celebration to Swanson's industrially produced turkey meal for one ('Just heat and serve'). Modernity is surely a lonelier place than the world that preceded it. The question is why. It isn't ultimately technology (cities, cars or screens) that have made us lonely; it's an identifiable set of ideas. We have rendered ourselves lonely first and foremost because of certain stories we have started to tell about what loneliness means. Most eras before our own knew that solitude did not - per se - have to be a sign of wretchedness or deficiency. In the fourth century, the greatest saint of early Christianity, Saint Anthony, was said to have spent more than forty years by himself in Egypt's Western desert, not saying a word, eating only bread and salt, communing with God. So impressed were some with St Anthony's life, they came to join him in the desert, and became collectively known as the Desert Fathers, and their philosophy of solitary piety would go on to have a decisive influence on the founding of monasteries. At the height of monasticism in the Middle Ages, a million people across Europe and north Africa had chosen to forego the bustle of family and commerce in order to dwell, in some of the most rugged and remote terrain in the world, in silent contemplation of God However, in the wake of the Reformation and the destruction of the monasteries that accompanied it, solitary piety began to lose its prestige and recede as a practical option. Those who had previously lived alone at the tops of mountains were now encouraged to serve God by remaining in the community, finding a suitable spouse - and starting a family. To this newly social religious impetus was added the influence of Romanticism, a movement of ideas that - with different ends in view - similarly encouraged people to give up on thorough commitments to their own company and questioned the honour of solitude. For the Romantics, happiness lay in identifying one exceptional soulmate to whom one could surrender one's independence and with whom one might fuse mind and body. In the process, the Romantic movement turned solitude from a respectable choice, to evidence of pathology. When the Beatles released Eleanor Rigby in 1966, the song that more than any other defined what loneliness meant for the modern age, it was at once clear why Eleanor was a lamentable figure. The famous face that she kept in a jar by the door had been intended for the enchanting partner that, like all single people, she must have longed to find. Only with romantic love could there be a decent life, so ran the philosophy of the song, of all the Beatles' works and in fact, of every modern pop song every written. Fail to fall completely in love and, Romanticism warned, one would soon enough be picking up rice in the church where a wedding had been - or rivalling for strangeness the comparably odd Father Mackenzie, around whom there seemed so little of the glamour that had once attended the Desert Fathers. The modern world not only made it mandatory to have a partner. It made it feel essential to have a vibrant gang of friends - and to enjoy seeing them regularly at parties. An empty diary became an emblem of deformity. But there was not the slightest admission that it might, all things considered, be a distinctly curious thing to stand in a crowded room full of status-panicked, socially-anxious people, every one of them terrified of honesty or failure. In 1921, Carl Jung - in his book Psychological Types - introduced the terms 'extraverted' and 'introverted' to divide humanity. The former referred to a sort of person who could best realise their potential in the company of others; the latter were those who needed to move away from crowds and idle chatter in order to regain their integrity. 'Everyone possesses both mechanisms,' wrote Jung - but it was evident where the spirit of the age resided. It's been the achievement of a few, often at the time ignored artists of the modern period to make a case for introversion, to try to coat solitude in glamour. In a painting by Caspar David Friedrich, we are invited to trust that the lonely figure in the landscape is privy to insights that would be lost in the crowd down in the lowlands, he has needed to travel up to the mountains in order to put the bluster and envy of humans into perspective; We should dare to follow him in his trajectory. Separated by many decades, Gwen John's young woman doesn't seem to belong to any official religion. But if there were one dedicated to the appreciation of solitude, she would be one of its saintly and legendary figures. Her expression - kind, gentle, melancholy and lost in profundity - is an advertisement for all that modernity has neglected in its promotion of active, cheery lives. Isolation isn't a particular malediction; it's where good people tend to end up. We should dare to believe that we are in solitude not because we are ill but because we are noble of spirit. We don't hate company; it's just that we would prefer to stay home rather than accept the counterfeit tokens of community presently on offer. The way to make people feel less alone isn't to pull them out of their musings in the forest or in the diner, in the library or the desert - and force them to go bowling. It's to reassure them that being alone is no sign of failure. To lessen modernity's crisis of loneliness, we need for solitude to be rehabilitated and for singlehood to regain its dignity. There is nothing catastrophic about eating dinner, many dinners, on our own. The Swanson TV dinners might have been capable of improvement, but it is ultimately far better to be eating a basic meal in peace than to be in a ballroom surrounded by false smiles and oppressive judgements. When we do so, we aren't in fact on our own at all. We are - as modernity has failed to remind us - dining with some of the finest, most elevated spirits who have ever lived. We are, though ostensibly by ourselves, in the very best company. One of the trickiest tasks we ever have to face is that of working out who we really are. This book is designed to help us create a psychological portrait of ourselves with the help of some unusual, oblique, entertaining, and playful prompts.

    "Transcript": "The modern world purports to respect both introverts and their opposites but in practice, the glory all goes to the extroverts. To have any chance of seeming normal or achieving success, one has to impress strangers, attend conferences, make speeches, outshine competitors, manage people, join in with prevailing enthusiasms, socialise, travel a lot, go out often and date widely. It can take a very long time before we realise that – however much we might hope for this to be otherwise – this is not in fact us at all. For our part, we happen to get very worried before going to parties, we have felt close to death before giving speeches, any kind of social occasion perturbs us heavily, we're left extremely jittery by encounters with news and social media, we start to feel sick if we haven't had the chance to sit on our own and process our thoughts for a few hours every day, we're very awkward about having to be responsible for anyone at work and we are extremely wary of jolliness or demonstrations of group fervour. Conversely, we adore staying at home, we'd be quite happy spending a whole weekend (or even a few years) in our own company with some books and a laptop, we only properly like about three people in the world, we love exploring different rooms in our minds, we are reassured by friends who know how to confess their vulnerability and anxiety, we'd like never to have to go to a party again, we almost never complain that things are too quiet and we love peaceful landscapes and uneventful days. We quite like flowers too. All of this can bring intense suspicion to bear on us in the modern world. Why are we so timid? Why can't we sing along with everyone else? Why aren't we coming out to celebrate? We conclude that we are weird and possibly ill long before we can accept that we may just be very different. To be an introvert is to be constantly impacted by undercurrents and hidden electricity in situations that others will miss. What can make a party or a company meeting so exhausting for us is that we aren't merely expressing our thoughts and chatting, we'll wonder what everyone has made of what we've just said, we'll suspect that we have failed to understand an important dynamic, we'll be struck by a peculiar possible hostility from someone in the corner, we'll worry that our face has stuck in an unfortunate, gormless position. We are – when called upon – canny observers of the human comedy, but minute by minute, we are also hellishly and exhaustingly self-conscious. It sounds difficult, but an introverted life can also be a very grateful and rich life. We need so much less in order to have enough. We don't require noise and attention. We don't care where the giant party is. We just want to potter around in our boring clothes, chat to the few people we feel comfortable with, take walks and lie in the bath a lot. There can be so much in things if we let them resonate properly. How much we've already seen; how many journeys we've already been on; how much we've already read; what tumults we've already been through. We don't really need more. We're like children who don't need too much stimulation from outside. An hour at a lively birthday party and it's imperative for us to go straight home and have a nap. Recognising our introverted nature is not merely a piece of poetic self-knowledge. It belongs to our mental health – for failing to make the correct accommodation with our introversion is a fast route to overload and ensuing anxiety and paranoia. What we term a breakdown is often simply an introverted mind crying out for greater peace, rest, self-compassion and harmony. Experienced introverts therefore realise a need to push against the extroverted agenda. Their sanity relies on being able to cleave to the insular routines they need. We have at least got a vocabulary for explaining the structure of our personalities to others. The next step will be to learn how to honour it – and properly allow people to lead the quieter lives their temperaments crave and deserve. Our book on confidence walks us around the key issues that stop us from making more of our potential."

    "Title": "A Test to Judge How Good Your Parents Were",
    "Transcript": "Strangely, and rather awkwardly, it seems no human being can ever really grow up sane unless it has been loved very deeply by someone for a number of years in its early life. But we're still learning what parental love might actually involve. So how good were your parents? Here are eight principles of good parenting you can use to grade them. - Attunement A loving parent gets down to the child's level - at times literally, dropping to their height when addressing them - in order to see the world through their eyes. They understand that a very young child cannot easily fit in with external demands and that, in the early days, they must be prioritised and placed at the center of things, not in order to 'spoil' them, but in order to give them a chance to grow. - 'Small Things' Loving parents understand that their young offspring's lives revolve around details that are, by any adult measure, very minor. Toddlers will feel enormously happy because they can dig their nails into some putty or have a chance to wack their spoon into some peas with energy or say 'bah' very loudly; and they will feel extremely sad because pet rabbit lost one of its buttons or a page in a favourite book now has a tear in it. The good enough parent feels sufficiently resourceful inside itself not to hold it against the child that it is making a very big deal out of so-called 'nothing'. It will follow the child in its excitement over a puddle and it in its grief over an uncomfortable sock. It understands that the child's future ability to be considerate to other people and to handle genuine disasters will be critically dependent on having had its ample fill of sympathy for a range of age-appropriate sorrows. - Forgiveness A loving parent will know how to put the best possible interpretation on behaviour that might seem to others unfortunate and grating: the small child isn't 'a troublemaker', but it has of course been very upset by the arrival of its sibling. It isn't 'antisocial' but it does find a small circle of familiar people especially soothing. It isn't a 'nightmare' but it does surely need to go to bed very soon. This capacity for imaginative kindly explanations will go on to mould the workings of the child's own conscience; it will learn the art of self-forgiveness. It won't have to torture itself for its mistakes. It won't suffer the ravages of self-loathing or ever, when it messed up badly, be tempted to take its own life. - Strange Phases The loving parent will feel sufficiently sane to allow a child to be weird for a while, knowing that so-called weird is part of normal development. It won't get flustered that the child has decided to pretend it is an animal or wants to eat only red-coloured foods or has an imaginary friend living in the tree at the end of the garden. The adult will have faith in sanity emerging - and in the wisdom of exploring a lot of possible options before choosing to settle on reason. It will be able to remain calm over some intense tantrums and obsessions, it won't need to shut down irreverence at every turn, it will be patient around low moods and unruffled by adolescent surliness. the parent won't assign labels to the child that might fix it in a role it was only trying out. It will be wary of telling a child that it is 'the angry one', 'the little philosopher' or even 'the kind one': it will allow the child the luxury of picking its own identity. - Clinginess The good parent knows that children may well cling for a long while, and will never dismiss this natural need for reassurance in pejorative terms. It won't tell the child to buck up and be a 'good little man' or 'young lady who can make me proud'. It will know that those who end up securely attached and able to tolerate absence are those who were originally allowed to have as much dependence and connection as they needed. There will be few requests to be 'brave' at the school gates. - Perfection A good parent won't set themselves up as impossibly glamorous or remote, a figure whom a child might be tempted to idealise and ruminate over from afar. They will know how to be present and very ordinary around the house; dignified perhaps but also on occasion ratty, forgetful, silly and greedily keen to have too much desert. The good parent will know that parental quirks and flaws are there to remind a child to reconcile itself to its own humanity - and also eventually to leave home and get on with their own lives. - Boringness A good parent will know how to appear very boring. It will understand that what a child chiefly needs is a source of reliable calm, not fireworks and excitement (it has enough of these inside its own mind). It should be there, in the same place, saying more or less the same things, for decades. It should take care to be predictable and to edit out its surprising moods, the child doesn't need a full picture of every perturbance and temptation coursing through its carers' minds. The parent accepts that 'mummy' or 'daddy' are roles, not full representations; it should be the privilege of every child not to have to know its parents in complete detail. - Unreciprocated Love The good parent isn't looking for a balanced relationship. It is happy to give unilaterally. It doesn't need to be asked how its day was or what it thinks of the government's new policy on insurance. It knows that a child should be able to take a parent substantially for granted. The parent's reward for all their work won't ever be direct; it will arrive by noting, in many years time, that their child has developed into a very good parent themselves. Put simply: love is the considerate, tender, hugely patient behaviour displayed by an adult over many years towards a child who cannot help but be largely out of control, confused, frustrating and bewildered - in order that it might over time grow into an adult who can take its place in society without too much of a loss of spontaneity, without too much terror and with a basic trust in its own capacities and chances of fulfilment. It should be a matter of global consternation that, despite our many advances, we are still only at the dawn of knowing how to ensure that we all have the loving childhoods we deserve. How to overcome your childhood is a book that teaches us how character is developed, the concept of emotional inheritance, the formation of concepts of being good or bad and the impact of parental styles on the way we choose adult partners"

    "Title": "How Romantic Attachment Works",
    "Transcript": "This is a piece about attachment - geese, jackdaws, a man called Konrad Lorenz - and your love life. Konrad Lorenz, who was born in 1903 and died in 1989, was an Austrian ornithologist and zoologist who spent most of his adult life in marshes and wetlands studying the behaviour of greylag geese and jackdaws. What particularly interested him was how these birds seem to develop an attachment to their mother from within a few minutes of their birth, following dutifully behind her and obeying her guidance in matters of sheltering and feeding. His observations led him to develop what is known as 'the principle of imprinting', a theory about the way in which nidifugous birds - that is, birds that leave their nests just after hatching - grow to develop an instinctive and rapid bond with maternal figures. But what Lorenz discovered in his research was that, contrary to centuries of thinking, birds like greylag geese and jackdaws do not necessarily develop an attachment to their real mother; they develop an attachment to the first moving object that they lay eyes on within hours of hatching. They aren't able to discriminate in any sophisticated way about who they form an attachment to: it might be a kindly maternal bird, but it could also be an indifferent farmer or a random piece of agricultural machinery. Rather cruelly but illuminatingly, Lorenz showed that a young bird can - depending on the experiment - develop an extremely powerful attachment to a scientist in Wellington boots, a bicycle, a tire, a garden hose or a mannequin. Lorenz's most famous book, \"The Companion in the Environment of Birds\" published in 1935 talked exclusively of winged creatures, but it was seized upon by psychologists reflecting on human behaviour - and used to shed light on a particularly painful phenomenon of our love lives: our tendency to seek out and trot obediently behind other humans who may not, all things considered, be in any substantial way fitting or appropriate for us. Just like young birds, young humans develop powerful attachments to the adults who are closest to them in their early days. Yet also rather like birds, they are unable to discriminate very well between care-givers. They latch on to who is around, not what their deeper nature would ideally call for. They can, at the most extreme, develop attachments to people who not deserve their love at all, who are - as it were - as relevant to their needs as a bicycle is to a goose. An infant might not actually become attached to a tire, but they might - in a comparable process - grow powerfully impressed by someone who neglects them emotionally, who belittles them, makes them feel ashamed and visits considerable cruelty upon them. Far worse, this early imprinting then has the power to govern the sort of lovers who these people, once they are grown, find themselves growing attached to in turn. With some of the same sort of almost laughable impressionability evinced by baby jackdaws trotting behind a scientist in a lab coat, an adult who has been imprinted with unhelpful ideas about who should give them care and nurture may spend decades devoting themselves to the most inappropriate and callous figures. It seems - via Lorenz's work - that our biological make-up privileges attachment to anyone over attachment to someone able to fulfill our needs. We are sometimes puzzled by how frequently we find ourselves in love with people whom we know - at a rational level - are not going to be good for us, but who mirror the disturbing patterns of our attachments from early childhood. The process may seem deeply dispiriting but Lorenz's work opens up an avenue of compassion. We may be a great deal more sophisticated than birds in our mental processes, but when it comes to whom we are drawn to, we are prey to some of the same mechanical illogicality as they. It can take years and a lot of work to realise we are imprinted to follow fools and ingrates. When we trot without question behind a person who treats us coldly or plays with our mind, we should not merely hate ourselves: we should reflect on how much this unfulfilling adult mirrors an early attachment figure who indirectly mocked who we were before we had a chance to understand ourselves and what we deserved. It is no insult to recognise that we are sometimes, in intimate areas of our lives, as helpless before the workings of imprinting as a goose. And yet, as always, it's by realising our servitude that we have a chance to break free from it. We are not compelled to follow incessantly behind someone unworthy of our love. We are - as young birds are not - free to take off and seek out someone better able to deliver in an adult form the generous and life-enhancing love we should have known from the first. For more about love, try our book on how to find love which explains why we have the types we do and how our early experiences shape how and who we love."

    "Title": "Learning to Be Angry",
    "Transcript": "There are many reasons to believe that one of the dominant problems in the world today is an excess of anger. We know all about the very shouty and their antics: their tantrums, their lack of reason, their unwillingness to compromise. But it may be rather more realistic, albeit odd sounding, to insist on the very opposite: that whatever the impression generated by a publically vocal angry cohort, the far more common yet (by nature) invisible problem is a contrary tendency, a widespread inability to get angry, a failure to know how rightly and effectively to mount a complaint, an inarticulate swallowing of frustration - and the bitterness, subterranean 'acting out' and low-level depression that follow from not allowing any of our rightful sorrows to find expression. For every one person who shouts too loudly, there are at least twenty who have unfairly lost their voice. We are not talking here in praise of delirious rage, the sort that injures innocents and leads nowhere. The point isn't to rehabilitate barbarism, it's to make a case for an occasional capacity to speak up - with dignity and poise - in order to correct a reasoned sense that something isn't right - and that those around us need to take our perspective on board. We are - as a rule - hopeless at being angry from the very nicest of motives: in part, from a belief in the complexity of situations and the minds of other people, which undercuts enthusiasm for anything that smacks of self-righteousness or pride. We tell ourselves - in relationships or at work - that others must have their good reasons for behaving as they do, that they must be essentially kind and good and that it would be an insult to their efforts to raise our hand about a problem that we surely don't even entirely understand. We tend to import our modesty from childhood. It's a privilege to allow a child to manifest their frustration - and not all parents are game. Some are very keen on having a 'good child'. They let the infant know from the first that being 'naughty' isn't funny and that this isn't a family where children are allowed to 'run rings around' the adults. Difficult moods and tantrums, complaints and rages are not to be part of the story. This certainly ensures short-term compliance, but paradoxically, preternaturally good behaviour is usually a precursor of bad feelings, and in extremes mental unwellness, in adulthood. Feeling loved enough that one can tell parental figures to sod off and occasionally fling something (soft) across the room belongs to health; truly mature parents have rules and allow their children (sometimes) to break them. Otherwise, there is a species of inner deadness that comes from having had to be too good too soon and to resign one's point of view without a flicker of self-defence. In relationships, this might mean a tendency to get taken royally for a ride for many years, not in terms of outright abuse (though that too) but the kind of low-level humiliation and taken-for-grantedness which seems the lot of people who can't make a fuss. At work, an unwavering concern for politeness, empathy and gentleness may end up providing the perfect preconditions for being walked all over. We should - at times - relearn the neglected art of politely being a pain. The danger of those who have never shouted is that they might, in compensation, end up screaming. That isn't the point either. The goal is a firm but self-possessed protest: Excuse me, but you are ruining what's left of my life, I'm so sorry, but you are cauterising my chances of happiness; I beg your pardon, but this is enough... We have the speeches written in our heads already. There is likely to be a spouse, a parent, a colleague, or a child who hasn't heard enough from us for far too long - and who it would be of incalculable benefit to our heart-rate and our emotional and physical constitution to have a word with. The timid always imagine that anger might destroy everything good. They overlook - because their childhoods encouraged them to - that anger can also be a fertiliser from which something a lot less bitter and a lot more alive can emerge. Our arguments book is a guide to arguments in love.  It teaches us why they might occur what their symptoms are, how we could learn some wiser ways of communicating and how we would ideally  patch up after a fight."

    "Title": "Why We Need to Feel Heard",
    "Transcript": "One of our deepest longings – deeper than we even perhaps recognise day to to day – is that other people should acknowledge certain of our feelings. We want that – at key moments – our sufferings should be understood, our anxieties noticed and our sadness lent legitimacy. We don't want others necessarily to agree with all our feelings, but what we crave is that they at least validate them. When we are furious, we want another person to say: I can see that you've been driven to distraction. It must feel very chaotic for you inside right now for you. When we are sad, we want someone to say: I know you're unusually down and I understand the reasons why. And when we can't take it all any more, we want someone gently to say: It's been too much for you; I recognise that so well; of course it has. It sounds desperately simple, and in a way it is. And yet how little of this emotional nectar of acknowledgement we ever in fact receive or gift to one another. The habit of not having one's feelings properly acknowledged begins in childhood. Parents, even the most loving ones, frequently stumble in this domain. It's not that they don't theoretically care intensely for their children, it's that they don't appreciate that true care involves regularly reflecting a child's moods back to him or herself – rather than subtly pushing the moods away or denying that they exist. Here are some typical unacknowledging parent-child exchanges:Child: I'm feeling sad. Parent: Don't be silly, you can't be, it's the holidays.Child: I'm really worried. Parent: Darling, now that's that's ridiculous, there's just nothing to be scared of here.Child: I wish there wasn't any school ever ever. Parent: Don't be so silly. You know we have to leave the house by eight.How different things might go, and what a different sort of adult the child would have a chance to grow into, if such dialogues were only slightly tweaked: if, for example, the parent could say: 'It's weird isn't it how it's possible to be sad at the oddest of times, even on a beach holiday…' Or: 'I can see you're scared: that wind is really fierce out there…' Or: 'It must be horrible having double maths all morning, especially after such a nice weekend…' There is one reason why we don't acknowledge as we might: fear. The feelings we push away are all, in some shape or other, emotionally inconvenient, or troubling or upsetting: we love our child so much, we don't want to imagine that they might be sad or worried, lost or having a terribly difficult time at school. Furthermore, we may operate with a background view that acknowledging a difficult feeling will make it far worse than it is. It will mean fostering it unduly or giving way to it entirely. We fear that if we give a bit of unbiased mirroring to our child, we might be encouraging them to grow cataclysmically depressive, unfeasibly timid or manically resistant to authority. What we're missing is that most of us, once we've been heard, become far less – rather than far more – inclined to insist on the feelings we're beset by. The angry person gets less rather than more enraged once the depth of their frustration has been recognised; the rebellious child grows more, not less inclined, to buckle down and do their homework once their feelings that they want to burn the school down, break the headmaster's glasses and abscond to a desert island have been listened to and identified with for fifty-five seconds. Feelings get less strong, not more tyrannous, as soon as they've been given an airing. We become bullies when no one's listened, never because they listened too much. The problem of unacknowledged feelings doesn't – sadly – end with childhood. Couples routinely put each other through the same mill. For example:Partner 1: Sometimes I feel that you don't listen… Partner 2: That has to be rubbish; I put so much work into this relationship.Partner 1: I'm worried I might be fired Partner 2: That's not possible, you work so hard.All the way to the divorce courts – or an affair.The good news is that an enormous uplift in mood is available right now, with very little effort, if we simply learn to change the way we typically respond to the I-statements of those who matter to us. We only need to play their feelings back to them, even the potentially awkward feelings, for a few moments using certain magical phrases: I can hear that you must… You must be feeling so… I can understand completely that… Such phrases can change the course of lives. Crucially, we don't need to be listened to by everyone. We can bear an awful lot of unacknowledged feelings when just a few people, some of them in our childhood, and ideally one of them in our bedroom and in our friendship circle every now and then plays us back to us. The ranter, the person animated by a rigid desire that everyone should listen to them, hasn't (of course) been overindulged: they are just playing out the frightening consequences of never having been heard when it mattered. There is almost no end to what we may be ready to do for those who pay us that immense, psychologically-redemptive honour of once in a while acknowledging what we're actually feeling, however odd, melancholy or inconvenient it might be. Our Emotional First Aid kit provides a set of useful salves to some of life's most challenging psychological situations.  Including friendship, love, sex, work and self."

    "Transcript": "when we use the word modern to describe something it's usually a positive we're very appreciative and even a little smug about the miracles of modern science modern technology and even the superiority of modern viewpoints but what if in speeding towards a new and ever better future we've left some important truths about ourselves behind one of the people who best helps us to explore this problem is margaret mead perhaps the most famous anthropologist in the world margaret mead was born in the usa in 1901 the oldest of five children her father was a professor of finance and her mother was a sociologist after studying psychology as an undergraduate mead began a phd in the relatively new field of anthropology her supervisor franz boaz was the founder of the discipline in the united states unlike earlier anthropologists who'd imagined that civilization was progressing in a linear fashion from barbarism to savagery to civilization boaz argued that the world was teeming with separate cultures each with their own unique perspectives insights and deficiencies the modern western world was not the pinnacle of human achievement but simply one specific example of what humans could get up to boaz suggested that mead travel for her field work to samoa a few tiny volcanic tropical islands in the centre of the pacific ocean mead was particularly interested in primitive communities because she believed that such isolated cultures could serve as laboratories that would reveal ways of living that the modern world had forgotten about but needed to remember starting in 1925 and lasting until the beginning of the second world war mead lived in samoa in a highly authentic way for long periods she learnt the languages dressed like a local and even carried babies around by having them cling to her neck mead became fascinated by samoan attitudes to sex in particular in the book that made her name coming of age in samoa published in 1928 mead described samoan culture as far more open and comfortable with sex than the modern united states little children in samoa knew all about masturbation and learned about intercourse and other acts through first-hand observation but thought of it as no more scandalous or worthy of comment than death or birth homosexuality was incidental but also not a matter of shame and people's orientations fluctuated naturally throughout their lives without defining them this intrigued and inspired mead who herself led rather unconventional life simultaneously involved with successive husbands and an ever-present female lover another famous anthropologist called ruth benedict mead argued that the samoan approach to sex made adolescence far easier for girls there because there was little pressure for them to conform to particular kinds of sexuality they were neither pressured to abstain from sex nor to achieve particular milestones like having boyfriends or getting married gradually mead got interested in gender roles and discovered that modern societies are far more rigid in this area than primitive ones for example americans tend to think of men as productive sensible and aggressive while women are often told that they're more frivolous peaceful and nurturing but in her 1935 book sex and temperament in three primitive societies mead studied tribes in papua new guinea and recorded that in the arabesh tribe both men and women were peaceful and nurturing while among the mundagamore tribe men and women were both ruthless and aggressive in short me suggested that no gender traits are ever simply human nature they're all instead simply possibilities which are either taught encouraged or shunned by any given culture mead's striking conclusion is that it isn't gender that makes women curl their hair or listen to people's feelings or race that makes some nations regularly attack their neighbors rather it's the social expectations and norms that have developed slowly over centuries and which have laid the groundwork for each individual psychological makeup we must recognize she reminded her readers that beneath the superficial classifications of sex and race the same potentialities always exist recurring generation after generation only to perish because society has no place for them mead herself learned so much from her anthropological subjects she brought up her daughter according to some of the parenting ideas of the primitive people she worked with like breastfeeding on demand which she helped to popularize in modern day america during world war ii access to the south pacific was impossible so mead began to study more complex cultures like her own after the war mead worked for the u.s military studying russian responses to authority in order to try to predict what the soviets might do during the cold war she grew increasingly famous traveling widely giving lectures and teaching at universities for 50 years from 1928 until her death in 1978 she worked on and off for the american museum of natural history in new york city as a curator for their special projects she wrote 20 books in all and was awarded 28 honorary degrees mede's work helps us to use the experiences of other nations and people as a storehouse of good ideas as the traveler who has once been from home is wiser than he who's never left his own doorstep she suggested so a knowledge of another culture will always sharpen our ability to scrutinize our own more steadily in doing so she suggested we will always uncover and support undeveloped human potential forgotten in our rush towards modernity how to think more effectively is a book about how to optimize our minds so that they can more regularly and generously produce the sort of insights and ideas we need to fulfill our potential and achieve the contentment we deserve"

    "Title": "The Benefits of Crying",
    "Transcript": "One of the wisest things about young children is that they have no shame or compunction whatsoever about bursting into tears, perhaps because they have a more accurate and less pride-filled sense of their place in the world: they know they are extremely small beings in a hostile and unpredictable realm, that they can't control much of what is happening around them, that their powers of understanding are limited and that there is a great deal to feel distressed, melancholy and confused about. Why not then, on a fairly regular basis, sometimes for only a few moments at a time, collapse into some highly salutary sobs at the sheer scale of the sorrow of being alive? Unfortunately, such wisdom tends to get lost as we age. We get taught to avoid being, at all costs, that most apparently repugnant (and yet in fact deeply philosophical) of creatures: the cry-baby. We start to associate maturity with a suggestion of invulnerability and competence. We imagine it may be sensible to imply that we are unfailingly strong and in command of what is going on. But this is, of course, the height of danger and bravado. Realising one can no longer cope is an integral part of true endurance. We are in our essence and should always strive to remain cry-babies, that is, people who intimately remember their susceptibility to hurt and grief. Moments of losing courage belong to a brave life. If we do not allow ourselves frequent occasions to bend, we will be at great risk of one day fatefully snapping. We labour under the misapprehension that the only thing that could justify tears would be one clear and unambiguous catastrophe. But that is to forget how many miniscule elements go wrong every hour, how much supposedly 'small things' can impact us and how extremely heavy they may end up feeling in a bewilderingly short time. When the impulse to cry strikes us, we should be grown-up enough to consider ceding to it as we knew how to in the sagacity of our fourth or fifth years. We might repair to a quiet room, put the duvet over our heads and give way to unrestrained torrents at the horribleness of it all. We easily forget how much energy we normally have to expend fending off despair; now at last we can properly allow despondency to have its way. No thought should be too dark any more: we are obviously no good. Everyone is evidently extremely mean. It's naturally far too much. Our life is – undoubtedly – meaningless and ruined. If the session is to work, we need to touch the very bottom and make ourselves at home there; we need to give our sense of catastrophe its fullest claims. Then, if we have properly done our work, at a point in the misery, some idea – however – minor will at last enter our minds and make a tentative case for the other side: we'll remember that it would be quite pleasant and possible to have a very hot bath, that someone once stroked our hair kindly, that we have one and half good friends on the planet and an interesting book still to read – and we'll know that the worst of the storm is over. Despite our adult powers of reasoning, the needs of childhood constantly thrum within us. We are never far from craving to be held and reassured, as we might have been decades ago by a sympathetic adult, most likely a parent, who made us feel physically protected, kissed our forehead, looked at us with benevolence and tenderness and perhaps said not very much other than, very quietly, 'of course'. To be in need (as it were) of mummy is to risk ridicule, especially when we are a couple of meters tall and in a position of responsibility. Yet to understand and accept one's younger longings in fact belongs to the essence of genuine adulthood. There is in truth no maturity without an adequate negotiation with the infantile and no such thing as a proper grown-up who does not frequently yearn to be comforted like a toddler. In sensible households, we should all have signs, a bit like the sort they have in hotels, that we can hang on our doors and announce to passers by that we are spending a few minutes inside doing something essential to our humanity and inherently connected to our capacity to live like a grown-up: sobbing like a lost child.

We're meant to be above such pragmatic worries. Only cowards and reprobates would mind a few weekends (or decades) by themselves. We've heard of those books that sing the praises of solitude (the divorcee who relocated to a solitary hut on a bare Scottish island; the one who went sailing around the world in a dinghy). But we can admit that we're not naturals at this sort of thing: there have been empty days when we almost lost our minds. There was one trip that we took on our own years back that was, behind the scenes, a psychological catastrophe. We're not really in a position to wave away the dangers of being left alone on our rock. But without wishing to play down the dangers unduly, there are nevertheless one or two things we might learn to weaken our fears. We can begin with a simple observation: it's typically a lot worse to be on our own on a Saturday than on a Monday night; and a lot worse to be alone over the festive period than to be alone at the end of the tax year. The physical reality and the length of time we're by ourselves may be identical, but the feeling that comes with being so is entirely different. This apparently negligible observation holds out a clue for a substantial solution to loneliness. The difference between the Saturday and the Monday night comes down to the contrast between what being alone appears to mean on the two respective dates. On a Monday night, our own company feels like it brings no judgement in its wake, it doesn't in any way depart from the norms of respectable society, it's what's expected of decent people at the start of a busy week: we get back from work, make some soup, catch up on the post, do some emails and order a few groceries, without any sense of being unusual or cursed. The next day, when a colleague asks us what we got up to, we can relate the truth without any hot prickles of shame. It was – after all – just a Monday night. But Saturday night finds us in a far more perilous psychological zone: we scan our phone for any sign of a last minute invitation, we flick through the channels in an impatient and disconsolate haze, we are alive to our own tragedy as we eat tuna from a can, we take a long bath at 8.30pm to try to numb the discomfort inside with scalding heat on the outside; and as we prepare to turn out the light just after ten, the high-spirited cries of revellers walking by our house seem to convey a targeted tone of mockery and pity. On Monday morning, we pass over the whole horrid incident with haste. From this we conclude: being alone is bearable in relation to how 'normal' (that highly nebulous yet highly influential concept) the condition feels to us at any given point; it can either be a break from an honourably busy life, or sure evidence that we are an unwanted, wretched, disgusting and emotionally diseased being. This is tricky but ultimately very hopeful, for it suggests that if only we could work on what being alone means to us, we could theoretically end up as as comfortable in our own skin on a long summer Saturday night filled with the joyous cries of our fellow citizens as on the dreariest Monday in November, and we could spend the whole holiday season by ourselves feeling as relaxed and as unself-conscious as we did when we were a child and hung out for days by ourselves, tinkering with a project in the floor of our bedroom, with no thought in the world that anyone would as a result think us sad or shameful. We may not – after all – need a new companion (something which can be hard to find in a panic); we just need a new mindset (which we can take care of by ourselves, starting right now). To build ourselves a new mental model of what being alone should truly mean, we might rehearse a few of the following arguments: – Our Solitude is Willed Despite what an unfriendly voice inside our heads might tell us, we are the ones who have chosen to be alone. We could, had we so wanted, been in all sorts of company. Our solitude is – though it may not feel like it – willed rather than imposed. No one ever needs to be alone so long as they don't mind who they are with. But we do mind, and we have some very good reasons to do so. The wrong kind of company is a great deal lonelier for us than being by ourselves, that is, it's further from what matters to us, more grating in its insincerity and more of a reminder of disconnection and misunderstanding than is the conversation we can have in the quiet of our own minds. It's not that we have been rejected by the world; it's that we've taken a good look at the available options and have – with wisdom – done some rejecting ourselves. – Beware the outward signs of Companionship It seems, from a distance, as if everyone is having an ecstatic time. The Party (what we imagine in our darkest moments to be the unitary joyous social event from which we've been blocked) grips our imaginations. We've passed the restaurants and seen the groups leaning back on their chairs and laughing uproariously, we've seen the couples holding hands and the families packing up for their glorious holidays abroad. And we know the depths of fun that are unfolding. But we need to hold on to what we recognise in our sober moments is a more complicated reality: that there is naturally going to be alienation at the restaurant, bitterness in the couples and despair in the sunny island hotels. We picture intimacy and communion, deep understanding and the most sophisticated varieties of kindness. We are sure that 'everyone' is having precisely what we understand by true love. But they are not. They will for the most part be together but still alone, they will be talking but largely not heard. Isolation and grief are not unique to us; they are a fundamental part of the human experience, they trail every member of our species, whether in couples or alone, life is a hellish and anxious business for all of us; we've chosen to experience the pains of existence by ourselves for now, but having a partner has never protected anyone from the void for very long. We should take care to drown our own individual sorrows in the ocean of a redemptive and darkly funny universal pessimism. No one is particularly much enjoying the journey; we are not built that way. As we should never have allowed ourselves to forget in front of the steamed up windows of restaurants, life simply is suffering for most of us for most of the time. – We get statistics wrong To compound our errors, we are the most hopeless statisticians. We should pin a notice to our kitchen wall reminding us of just this fact. We say that 'everyone' is happy, and 'everyone' is in a couple. But we haven't taken the first steps towards properly evaluating what is going on in a factual sense. We are letting self-disgust, not mathematics, decide our vision of 'normality'. If we really surveyed the question, if we grew wings and went up and examined the city, swooping in on this bedroom here and that office there, those families in the park and that couple on a date, we'd see something altogether different. We'd see millions of others like us and far far worse: this one crying over a letter, that one shouting they've had enough, this one complaining that they can't be understood, that one weeping in the bathroom over an argument. It is regrettable enough to be sad, we don't need to compound the misery by telling ourselves – through an absurd misunderstanding of statistics – that it is abnormal to be so. – There is nothing shameful in what we're doing Our images of being alone lack dignity. We need better role models. Those on their own aren't always the cobwebbed hunched figures of our nightmares. Some of the greatest people who have ever lived have chosen, for a variety of noble reasons, to spend a lot of time by themselves. For our own self-compassion, we need to keep the difference between enforced and willed solitude firmly in consciousness. Here is a world-reknown scientist, spending twenty years on their own to finish a book that will change everything. Here is one of the most beautiful people nature has yet produced, alone in their room, playing the piano. Here is a politician who once led the nation, now preferring their own company. Those who are by themselves don't comprise only the desperate cases, they number many of those one would feel most privileged to meet. – Understand your past The sense of shame you experience at being in your own company is coming from somewhere very particular: your own childhood, and in particular, from an unloveable vision of yourself that you picked up in the early years. Somewhere in the past, someone left you feeling unworthy and now, whenever you suffer a reversal, the story is ready to re-emerge, confirming what you think is a fundamental truth about you: that you don't deserve to exist. It's not essentially that you're afraid of being lonely; it's that you don't like yourself very much – for which the cure is immense sympathy and psychotherapeutic understanding but not, it seems, the company of a partner you no longer care for or respect. Once we can like ourselves more, we won't need to be so scared of friendship with ourselves; we will know that others aren't laughing at us cruelly and that there is no delightful party we've been barred from. We'll appreciate that we can be both on our own and a fully dignified, legitimate member of the human race. We'll have conquered the terror of loneliness – and therefore at last be in a position to assess our options correctly and chose freely whether to stay in or leave a relationship we're in. Our book what is psychotherapy tells us exactly what going through psychotherapy is like and why it is so important."

    "Title": "I Am NOT My Body!",
    "Transcript": "A characteristic emotion on seeing a favourite novel turned into a film is puzzlement. We may not hate the actor playing a particular role, we might even find them rather beautiful, it's just that they tend not to be as we imagined they should be. We never thought that Tolstoy's Anna Karenina or Ishiguro's Stevens or Jane Austen's Marianne Dashwood or Scott Fitzgerald's Gatsby would look like quite… like that! When we originally read the novel, we didn't necessarily even imagine what they would look like. Their identity was free of the tyrannical requirement for a face. We were liberated to 'see' them in their unbounded entirety, because we did not have to visualise them concretely. Their appearances were fluid and, where necessary, hazy, so as better to allow their multiplicity to take form. By not having to look a certain way, they could be far more than just one thing. The discomfort we feel at the cinema reflects, on a small scale, the pain we are likely to experience with far greater force closer to home: in the bathroom mirror, in relation to ourselves. Here too we are prone to looking at the face in front of us and thinking – even if we do not hate how we look, though we probably do – that our features are in multiple ways extremely unfaithful to how it feels to be us. As with a character in a novel, we know ourselves in the comforting darkness of the inner mind where we don't place strict boundaries or blunt conclusions on who we might be. We give ourselves latitude. We know we have a thousand moods, that we are a bewildering mixture of the kind and the selfish, the immoral and the good, the confused and the clear-eyed. We know that we harbour infinite possibilities; that we are at once artists, ploughmen, accountants, babies, presidents, lunatics, men, boys, girls, women, dolphins, okapis, jellyfish and ballerinas. Pretty much any life form that has ever bubbled up and breathed on the earth has some echo inside us. How perplexing, therefore, to have to look in the mirror and be obtusely presented with just one particular person, with one predominant expression, one rather serious nose, one set of sensible ears and one pair of cautious lips. This perplexing feeling first descends in adolescence. If we are frequently to be found dazed on the sofa at that age, or snappy towards our parents or melancholic in a shapeless black tunic, it is hardly a surprise given that we have recently – and probably for the first time – become properly aware of how our bodies must look to others – and what a cage we are condemned to inhabit, having once blithely assumed that we might be as free of definition as a cloud or an ellipsis. Our face in the mirror may come as no less of a surprise for us than would, for a reader, the arrival of a random Hollywood star in the space of a fictional persona. Someone is playing us – and we're really not sure we like who has been cast. We're sometimes given advice on how to cope at this point. We must learn to love what has happened to us and who, equipped with this new body, we have turned out to be. We should consider ourselves with enthusiasm and gratitude – and to interpret our bodies as a gift of nature. We are, whatever we feel, beautiful. We should give ourselves a hug. The advice is well-meaning and in its place apt. But there might be another, starker philosophy to try out too. We might look at the face in the mirror and pull an incensed mutinous smile as if to say: that really is not me and never will be. Rather than attempting to overcome our initial discomfiture, we might hold on to it and make a cult of it, founding a major part of our identity on a gutsy and insolent refusal to take on board the so-called 'gift of nature' we can't stand. Following Kingsley Amis in his truculent description of his body as an 'idiot' to whom he was chained, we might consider our appearance as a banal and ridiculous actor to whom a malevolent casting agent had mysterious decided to shackle us – and to whom we owe no particular favours or loyalty. We might think of our body as a taxi the universe has rudely shoved us into, not a vehicle we have carefully had the opportunity to choose – and to deserve. Out of such insubordination can come a liberating lightness. No longer do we have to worry whether or not we are our own faces; we'll know for sure we absolutely aren't. We'll hint to the world that there are armies of people, beings funnier and sadder, cleverer and simpler, more masculine and more feminine, struggling to get out. At the same time, we'll be able to bring our knowledge of the radical disconnection between outer form and inner character to bear on our views of others. We'll cease taking their appearance as any sort of truth. We'll know that they are likely to feel as let down by their bodies as we do. We'll come to 'see' beauty where no one else has learnt to spot it, because we'll be looking with new, and more penetrating sorts of eyes. And most importantly, we'll feel compassion, for ourselves and others, for the blatant injustice of the facial lottery that we have all been compelled to play."

    "Title": "Albert Camus  - The Plague",
    "Transcript": "In January 1941, the twenty-eight year old French writer Albert Camus began work on a novel about a virus that spreads uncontrollably from animals to humans and ends up destroying half the population of a representative modern town. It was called La Peste/The Plague, eventually published in 1947 and frequently described as the greatest European novel of the postwar period. The book - written in sparse, haunting prose - takes us through a catastrophic outbreak of a contagious disease in the lightly fictionalised town of Oran on the Algerian coast, as seen through the eyes of the novel's hero, a Doctor Rieux, a version of Camus himself. As the novel opens, an air of eerie normality reigns. 'Oran is an ordinary town,' writes Camus, 'nothing more than a French Prefecture on the coast of Algeria.' The inhabitants lead busy money-centered and denatured lives; they barely notice that they are alive. Then, with the pacing of a thriller, the horror begins. Dr Rieux comes across a dead rat. Then another and another. Soon the town is overrun with the mysterious deaths of thousands of rats, who stumble out of their hiding places in a daze, let out a drop of blood from their noses and expire. The inhabitants accuse the authorities of not acting fast enough. The rats are removed - and the town heaves a sigh of relief but Dr Rieux suspects that this is not the end. He has read enough about the structure of plagues and transmissions from animals to humans to know that something is afoot. Soon an epidemic seizes Oran, the disease transmitting itself from citizen to citizen, spreading panic and horror in every street. In order to write the book, Camus immersed himself in the history of plagues. He read books on the Black Death that killed 50 million people in Europe in the 14th century; the Italian plague of 1629 that killed 280,000 people across the plains of Lombardy and the Veneto, the great plague of London of 1665 as well as plagues that ravaged cities on China's eastern seaboard during the 18th and 19th centuries. In March 1942, Camus told the writer André Malraux that he wanted to understand what plague meant for humanity: 'Said like that it might sound strange,' he added, 'but this subject seems so natural to me.' Camus was not writing about one plague in particular, nor was this narrowly, as has sometimes been suggested, a metaphoric tale about the recent Nazi occupation of France. Camus was drawn to his theme because, in his philosophy, we are all - unbeknownst to us - already living through a plague: that is a widespread, silent, invisible disease that may kill any of us at any time and destroy the lives we assumed were solid. The actual historical incidents we call plagues are merely concentrations of a universal precondition, they are dramatic instances of a perpetual rule: that we are vulnerable to being randomly exterminated, by a bacillus, an accident or the actions of our fellow humans. Our exposure to plague is at the heart of Camus's view that our lives are fundamentally on the edge of what he termed 'the absurd'. Proper recognition of this absurdity should not lead us to despair pure and simple. It should - rightly understood - be the start of a redemptive tragi-comic perspective. Like the people of Oran before the plague, we assume that we have been granted immortality and with this naivety come behaviours that Camus abhorred: a hardness of heart, an obsession with status, a refusal of joy and gratitude, a tendency to moralise and judge. The people of Oran associate plague with something backward that belongs to another age. They are modern people with phones, trams, aeroplanes and newspapers. They are surely not going to die like the wretches of 17th century London or 18th century Canton. 'It's impossible it should be the plague, everyone knows it has vanished from the West,' says one character. 'Yes, everyone knew that,' Camus adds sardonically, 'except the dead.' For Camus, when it comes to dying, there is no progress in history, there is no escape from our frailty; being alive always was and will always remain an emergency, as one might put it, truly an inescapable 'underlying condition'. Plague or no plague, there is always - as it were - the plague, if what we mean by this is a susceptibility to sudden death, an event that can render our lives instantaneously meaningless. And yet still the citizens deny their fate. Even when a quarter of the city is dying, they keep imagining reasons why the problem won't happen to them. The book isn't attempting to panic us, because panic suggests a response to a dangerous but short term condition from which we can eventually find safety. But there can never be safety - and that is why for Camus we need to love our fellow damned humans and work without hope or despair for the amelioration of suffering. Life is a hospice, never a hospital. Camus writes: 'Pestilence is so common, there have been as many plagues in the world as there have been wars, yet plagues and wars always find people equally unprepared. When war breaks out people say: 'It won't last, it's too stupid.' And war is certainly too stupid, but that doesn't prevent it from lasting. The citizens of Oran were like the rest of the world, they were humanists: they did not believe in pestilence. A pestilence does not have human dimensions, so people tell themselves that it is unreal, that it is a bad dream which will end. The people of our town were no more guilty than anyone else, they merely forgot to be modest and thought that everything was still possible for them, which implied that pestilence was impossible. They continued with business, with making arrangements for travel and holding opinions. Why should they have thought about the plague, which negates the future, negates journeys and debate? They considered themselves free and no one will ever be free as long as there is plague, pestilence and famine.' At the height of the plague, when five hundred people a week are dying, one of Camus's particular enemies in the novel steps into a view, a Catholic priest called Paneloux. He gives a sermon to the city in the cathedral of the main square - and seeks to explain the plague as god's punishment for depravity. But Camus's hero Dr Rieux loathes this approach. The plague is not a punishment for anything deserved. That would be to imagine that the universe was moral or had some sort of design to it. But Dr Rieux watches a young innocent child die in his hospital and knows better: suffering is entirely randomly distributed, it makes no sense, it is no ethical force, it is simply absurd and that is the kindest thing one can say of it. The doctor works tirelessly against death, he tries to lessen the suffering of those around him. But he is no saint. In one of the most central lines of the book, Camus writes: 'This whole thing is not about heroism. It's about decency. It may seem a ridiculous idea, but the only way to fight the plague is with decency.' A character asks Rieux what decency is. Doctor Rieux's response is as clipped as it is eloquent: 'In general, I can't say, but in my case I know that it consists in doing my job.' Despite the horror, Camus (who in an earlier essay had compared humanity to the wretched character of Sisyphus but then asked us to imagine Sisyphus 'happy') maintains a characteristically keen sense of what makes life worth enduring. His Doctor Rieux appreciates dancing, love and nature; he is hugely sensitive to the smell of flowers, to the colours at sunset and - like Camus - adores swimming in the sea, slipping out after an evening on the wards to surrender himself to the reassuring immensity of the waves. Eventually, after more than a year, the plague ebbs away. The townspeople celebrate, it is apparently the end of suffering. Normality can return. But this is not how Camus sees it. Doctor Rieux may have helped to defeat this particular outbreak of the plague but he knows there will always be others: 'Rieux knew that this chronicle could not be a story of definitive victory. It could only be the record of what had to be done and what, no doubt, would have to be done again, against this terror… As he listened to the cries of joy that rose above the town, Rieux recalled that this joy was always under threat. He knew that this happy crowd was unaware of something that one reads in books, which is that the plague bacillus never dies or vanishes entirely, that it remains dormant for dozens of years, that it waits patiently in bedrooms, cellars, trunks, handkerchiefs and old papers, and that the day will come when...the plague will once again rouse its rats and send them to die in some new well-contented city.' Camus speaks to us in our own times not because he was a magical seer who could intimate what the best scientists could not, but because he correctly sized up human nature and knew about a fundamental and absurd vulnerability in us that we cannot usually bear to remember. In the words of one of his characters, Camus knew, as we do not, that 'everyone has inside it himself this plague, because no one in the world, no one, can ever be immune.'"

    "Title": "5 Ways to Spot Emotional Immaturity",
    "Transcript": "We have just launched a special membership to our YouTube channel.  Sign up today for a host of unique benefits including monthly discount codes for our online shop,  custom wallpapers, badges and emojis, as well as an exclusive chance to vote on topics for future films you'd like us to make. The best thing about physical maturity is that it's very easy to spot; we can so easily tell when someone has another decade of growth to go – and can therefore set our expectations, and our levels of forbearance accordingly. But we have no such luxury when it comes to emotional maturity. Here we can be constantly surprised by whom we have on our hands. The most stunning forms of immaturity can coexist with all the trappings of adult life and a confident and knowledgeable manner. It may be a long time into a love affair or working relationship before we realise that we are unwittingly dealing with an emotional neophyte. It pays, therefore, to try to arrive at a few general guidelines for how an emotionally immature person can be spotted and if necessary skirted very fast. Here are some of the lines that emotionally immature people have tendencies to come out with in conversation and that should, at the very least, set alarms ringing: 'I'm not so good at spending time on my own.' What separates the mature from the immature is, perhaps more than anything else, a capacity for being on their own, without distraction, and thinking about who they are and what they have experienced. The mature person can allow themselves to examine and as it were 'feel' their own feelings, even when these are very difficult and hugely unwelcome. They can stomach an encounter with their own rage, their own envy, their own shame. They don't have to do what the immature person is compelled to do: constantly find someone or something else to prevent them from any risk of understanding their own mind. 'I don't really remember much about my childhood.' There are very few childhoods in which difficult things didn't unfold. Without anyone meaning for this to happen, with the best intentions, children's development gets impeded and bruised. What counts therefore isn't that someone had a 'happy' childhood (almost no one on the planet did entirely), but that a person should have a calm and insightful view of what their childhood was actually like, in its good and bad aspects. An inability to remember much about the past doesn't indicate that it was idyllic or just 'a long time ago…', rather that it hasn't begun to be processed. 'I've never really thought about that before…' Emotionally immature people have great difficulties with conversations that require them to draw on a knowledge of their own enthusiasms, sorrows, projects and histories. So, as one sits with them over a drink and asks, for example, why their last relationship broke up, or what meaningful work constitutes for them or what they regret most from childhood, one has an above average chance of hearing (perhaps quite sweetly) a reply along the lines that this is all too new and that they have 'never thought about this before'. It isn't that the emotionally immature person is being cagey; they simply haven't properly inhabited, in its authentic pain and intensity, the life they are actually leading. 'Everything is pretty good. It's fine, all fine…' It would be churlish to begrudge anyone a good mood. Nevertheless, the emotionally immature person isn't often just in a good mood, they are rigidly unable to enter a bad one. Everything is declared fine (their parents, job, love affair, sex life, ambitions) because they have no resources for coping with anything that might be more nuanced and more real, that might entail anger, loss, confusion or wayward desires. One comes away from a dialogue with such a person disoriented and lonely at the idea that any life could be quite so cheerily one-dimensional. 'That's just a load of old psychobabble…' As soon as a conversation threatens their emotional integrity, the emotionally immature person will shut it down with the imperious verdict that it is a piece of over-complicated nonsense. They appeal to an idea of robust simplicity instead, as though the origins of all our problems might lie in thinking too much. It's the sort of attitude that might lead them to recommend that an anxious person 'pull themselves together' or to claim that a lot of mental distress comes from not getting out enough. But of course, none of this stems from confidence: it's a terrified way of blocking one's ears and saying 'No' to truths that might hurt very much. Emotionally immature people can be extremely charming and at points entertaining to be around. But as a general rule, we'd be advised to give them a very wide berth indeed and aim to check in on them in a decade or two. Life is in the end far too short, far too interesting and far too lonely to spend very long around people who lack any interest in trying to be, where it counts, emotional grown ups.

    "Title": "How Best to Manage Your Moods",
    "Transcript": "Far more than we are inclined to accept and sometimes even realise, we are creatures of mood: that is, our sense of our value as human beings is prone to extraordinary fluctuation. At times, we know how to tolerate ourselves, the future seems benevolent, we can bear who we are in the eyes of others and we can forgive ourselves for the desperate errors of the past. And then, at other points, the mood dips and we lament most of what we've ever done, we see ourselves as natural targets for contempt, we feel undeserving, guilty, weak and headed for retribution and disaster. But it can be very hard to grasp what causes our moods to shift. A day that started with energy and hope can, by lunchtime, end up mired in self-hatred and tearfulness. A sure sense that we've finally turned the corner and are on the way to better things can be replaced at speed by an alternative certainty that we are a cosmic error. We cannot, it appears, ever prevent our moods from being subject to change, but what is open to us all is to learn how to manage the change more effectively – so that our downturns can be ever so slightly more gentle, our sadness more containable and our inconstancy less shameful in our own eyes. Here is some of what we might learn to bear in mind around our capricious moods: Realise our Vulnerability We should acknowledge how vulnerable our moods are to being perturbed by so-called 'small things'. We belong to a species of extreme but also fateful sensitivity; we shouldn't expect to be able to appreciate a Mozart aria or a Rembrandt self-portrait on the one hand and then, on the other, stay unbothered by the downturned corners of the mouth of a lover or the slightly distant gaze of a would-be client. We shouldn't berate ourselves for how thin our skin is; we should adjust ourselves to the full consequences of our extraordinary openness to experience. Edit Social Life Unless we take vigorous measures to edit our social lives, we can too easily find ourselves in the company of people who, though they may call themselves our friends, are – in terms of what they do to our moods – no such thing. Beneath a veneer of kindness, these people are the bearers of latent hostility, deadly competitiveness, self-absorbed hysteria or priggish moralism. To start to be a friend to ourselves means learning to take a scalpel to our address list in order to edit out such dispiriting impostors. Vulnerable Friendships The one great solace for a low mood is the right sort of company: people who know how to reassure us that we still belong, that sadness is to be expected and that our errors never put us beyond compassion. These consoling souls will have suffered, they will have hated themselves and they will have learnt how to laugh at the absurdity of being human. Most importantly, when we show them our low mood, they will know how gracefully to take that most essential next step of friendship: accept our flaws and display one or two of their own. Honour the Body Maddeningly, some of why our moods shift is that we inhabit a body. But because it's so humiliating to have to accept that our ideas about ourselves and our lives might be dependent on bodily factors – how long we slept, how much water we've drunk, what viruses we are fighting in the background – the temptation can be to insist that our ideas must solely be the offspring of reason. It would be wiser to interpret that most of what passes through our minds is in some way dependent on particular things going on in our bodies. At points, it isn't that it's all over and that we're the worst person on earth, it's just that we may need to lie down for an hour or urgently have a glass of orange juice. Disrespect a mood Moods are proud, imperious things. They show up and insist that they are telling us total certainties about our identities and our prospects – perhaps that our love lives will never work out or that a professional situation is beyond repair. But we always have an option of calling their bluff, of realising that they are only a passing state of mind arrogantly pretending to be the whole of us – and that we could, with courage, politely ignore them and change the subject. We might recognize but not give way to the mood and put a bit of distance between it and our conscious selves. We might at times even do precisely what a mood commands us not to do: see someone rather than cede to shame, show our face rather than give way to paranoia, go out for a walk rather than fold our limbs into the foetal position. While we are being rocked by a dark mood, we should strive to keep a little light on, the light of sanity and self-kindness that can tell us, even though the hurricane is insisting otherwise, that we are not appalling, that we have done nothing unforgiveable and that we have a right to be. We can strive to keep ourselves plugged into a small pilot light of kindness until a larger sun is ready to rise once more. Not only do difficult moods insist that they are correct, they also seek to convince us that they are permanent. But our sense of self is naturally viscous; we are condemned to rise and fall, flow and ebb. We are, as a reality and as a metaphor, largely made of water. We shouldn't allow a misplaced ideal of permanence to add to our sorrows. Though we may be unable to shift a mood, we can at least realise that it is only ever such a thing and that, in the inestimable words of the prophets, with the help of a few hours or days, it too shall pass.

    "Title": "How to Make People Feel Good About Themselves",
    "Transcript": "We tend to operate with the view that the best way to please people is not to bother them too much. We keep many of our dilemmas and confusions away from those we like, for fear of irritating or inconveniencing them and so spoiling the relationship. We may well have a voice echoing in our minds from childhood: 'Don't bother your mother, can't you see she's exhausted from her trip? Don't bother your father, he works hard for us and he's busy right now…' There are powerful reasons why we equate making others happy with burdening them as little as possible. But our analysis is missing a key detail of human psychology: we like to be bothered. Not at all time and over all things, nor at the expense of our own critical needs, but fundamentally, we have a powerful urge to feel helpful. We need to be needed. All of us suffer from a fear of superfluity, which the requirements of others has a critical capacity to appease. However nice presents may be for our friends, the real gift we can offer them is an insight into our problems. We can pick this theme up in the realm of work. The dominant societal story is that we work strictly for ourselves: for our status and our financial benefit. But in reality, more puzzlingly but far more beautifully, what really makes our work feel exciting and meaningful is the power it gives us to help other people. Work is at its most gratifying when it affords us a feeling that we have, over the course of the day, managed to appease the suffering or increase the pleasure of another person. There are so many stories of being exhausted by the requests of others; too few of the delight we experience when we turn around someone else's distress, boredom or craving. We can't ultimately feel our valuable sides until we are called upon to exercise them: we don't have a sense of our strength until someone needs us to lift something; we can't feel intelligent until someone asks us to solve an issue; we can't feel wise until we've been brought in to adjudicate a dispute. We rely on the needs of others to remind us of what we're capable. ©Flickr/Didriks What holds true in professional life applies as much to personal experience. The best way to charm and break the ice with a new person we like the look of in a public place isn't to try to say something witty or soothing. We should strive to bring them a question. We should ask them whether we're in the right queue; whether they know when the post office opens – or if they have any idea how long a chicken this size might need in an oven. With closer friends too, we should dare to reveal our bemusements. We should ask them if they could possibly spare a moment, then solicit their views on what we might do about our angry teenage child, how we should cope with a sexless relationship or what they'd advise us about a colleague who is prone to panic. Our questions won't be a burden, they will show that we are ready to make ourselves vulnerable in their eyes – and therefore that we trust and think them wise. This isn't just a cynical strategy for ingratiating ourselves; it isn't Machiavellian or sly. We genuinely all need help. We aren't pretending to have problems and making up a few just to flatter. We are suffering inside, but simply generally don't dare to reveal the truth for fear of driving people away. And yet we are staying guarded out of an ideal of self-sufficiency that isn't either true to our needs or constructive for the well being and esteem of others. So, we should risk doing what we at heart have always longed to do: to reveal some of the fear, sadness and angst we genuinely feel to those we care about. We will be helped in our pain, we will remind others of their capacities – and, if we are fortunate, we'll set a precedent that means that others will one day bring a few of their problems to us in turn.

    "Title": "Self-Hatred & Anxiety",
    "Transcript": "The temptation, with dealing with anxiety, is always and invariably to focus on the ostensible cause of our worry: the journey to the airport, the forthcoming speech, the letter one is waiting for, the presentation one has to hand in… But if we proceed more psychologically, we might begin in a different place. With great kindness and no disrespect, we may step past the objective content of anxiety and look instead at something else: how the anxious person feels about themselves. An unexpected cause of high anxiety is self-hatred. People who have grown up not to like themselves very much at all have an above average risk of suffering from extremes of anxiety, because if one doesn't think one is worthy, it must follow that the world is permanently and imminently at high risk of punishing one in the way one suspects one deserves. It seems to fit that people may be laughing behind one's back, that one may soon be sacked or disgraced, that one is an appropriate target for bullying and rejection and that persecution and worse may be heading towards us. If things seem to be going well, this must just be the deceptively quiet period before others are about to realise their error and mete out some horrific punishment. For the self-hating, anxiety is a pre-emptive anticipation of the pain one unconsciously feels one is owed; very bad things must and should happen to very bad people. Part of the problem and one of the curious aspects of the way our minds work is that it isn't always clear that one is even suffering from low self-esteem; hating oneself has just become second nature rather than an issue one has the will to rebel against or so much as notice. To tease out the sorrow and start to feel it again (as a prelude to treating it), one might need to fire a few questions at oneself.  We've prepared a Self-Esteem Questionnaire 1. Broadly speaking, I like myself as I am. Agree strongly Agree Neither agree nor disagree Disagree Disagree strongly 2. People should be relatively grateful to have me in their lives. Agree strongly Agree Neither agree nor disagree Disagree Disagree strongly 3. If I didn't know me, I'd think I was OK. Agree strongly Agree Neither agree nor disagree Disagree Disagree strongly 4. Growing up, I was given the feeling that I properly deserved to exist. Agree strongly Agree Neither agree nor disagree Disagree Disagree strongly If one finds oneself at the disagreeing end of many such questions, it may be that one is an agitated person not because one has more to worry about but because one likes oneself rather less than normal – and certainly less than one fairly should. The cure isn't, therefore, to try to dispel anxieties with logic, it is to try to dispel it with love; it is to remind the anxious person (who may be ourselves) that we are not inherently wretched, that we have a right to exist, that past neglect wasn't deserved, that we should feel tenderly towards oneself – and that we need, both metaphorically and probably practically too, a very long hug. The logic of this analysis is truly counter-intuitive. It suggests that when panic next descends, one should not spend too long on the surface causes of the worry and instead, try to address the self-hatred fuelling the agitation. Anxiety is not always anxiety: sometimes it is just a very well-disguised, entrenched and unfair habit of disliking who we are.

    "Title": "Dating When You've Had a Bad Childhood",
    "Transcript": "In the course of any adult life, there will be periods when we'll end up involved in that slightly odd, slightly unrepresentative and invariably slightly challenging activity: looking. Most people around us won't be any the wiser, but with greater or lesser subtlety, we will be scanning: suggesting coffees and lunches, accepting every invitation, giving out our email addresses and thinking with unusual care about where to sit on train journeys. Sometimes the rigmarole will be joyful; at times, a bore. But for a portion of us, as many as one in four, it will count as one of the hardest things we ever have to do. Fun won't remotely come into it. This will be closer to trauma. And it will be so for a reason that can feel more humiliating still: because, a long time ago now, we had a very bad childhood – one whose impact and legacy we still haven't yet wholly mastered. It may not look like it, but babies are also looking out for love. They're not going out in party smocks or slipping strangers' their phone numbers. They are lying more or less immobile in cribs and are capable of little besides the occasional devastating cute smile. But they too are looking out for someone's arms to feel safe in; for someone who can soothe them, someone who can stroke their head, tell them it will all be OK when things feel desperate and lend them a breast to suck on. They are looking – as the psychologists call it – to get attached. But unfortunately, for one in four of us, the process goes spectacularly wrong. There is no one on hand to care properly. The crying goes unheeded, the hunger unassuaged. No one smiles reliably or cuddles confidently. There is no welcoming breast. In the eyes of the care-giver, there is depression or anger where there should have been delight and reassurance. And as a result, a fear of existence takes hold for the long term – and dating becomes a very hard business indeed. For those of us who experienced early let downs, there is simply little in us that can ever believe that a search for love will go well – and we will therefore bring an unholy commitment to bear on ensuring that it doesn't. The dating game becomes the royal occasion when we can confirm our deepest suspicion: that we are unworthy of love. We may, for example, fixate on a candidate who is – to more attuned eyes – obviously not interested; their coldness and indifference, their married-status or incompatible background or age, far from putting us off, will be precisely what feels familiar, necessary and sexually thrilling. This is what is meant to happen when we love: it should hurt atrociously and go nowhere. Or, in the presence of a potentially kind-hearted and available candidate, we may become so demanding and uncontained, so unreasonable and urgent in our requests, that no sane soul would remain in contention. We will spoil any potentially good impression by bringing a lifetime of self-doubt and loneliness onto the shoulders of an innocent stranger. Alternatively, unable to tolerate the appalling anxiety of not yet quite knowing where we stand, we may decide to settle the matter by ourselves, preferring to crash the plane than see how it might land. We'll interpret every ambiguous moment negatively, for sadness is so much easier to bear than hope: the slightly late reply must mean that they have found somebody else. Their busy-ness must be a disguise for sudden hatred. The missing x at the end of their message is conclusive evidence that they have seen through our sham facade. To master the terror of another letdown, we go cold, we respond sarcastically to sincere compliments and insist with aggression that they don't really care for us at all, thereby ensuring that they eventually won't. To escape these debilitating cycles, we need to accept that we're searching for someone to love us while wrestling with the most fateful of background suspicions: that we don't in any way deserve love. It's only by properly mastering what once happened to us, the letdown we first experienced as infants, that we can start to separate out past trauma from present reality – and therefore learn to navigate the ambiguities and occasional risks of adult dating. It isn't that we have been told that we don't deserve to exist; they're just busy tonight. They don't loathe us, they're married to someone else, as lots of people (who we carefully have chosen not to look at) happen not to be. They're not peculiar, it's just unfair and overwhelming to ask someone you've known for twelve hours to make up for a lifetime of loneliness. We need to see that this is not the first time we have been 'dating'. We have done it before long ago and it was the ways in which it went very wrong that holds the key to our adult errors – our intensity, our coldness and our lack of judgement. The catastrophe we fear will happen has already happened. The challenges we set up for ourselves are attempts to get back in touch with a trauma we haven't either understood or mourned. We can in time learn to ask people on a date because we grasp that we're not thereby asking them what we think we're asking: do I deserve to exist? We're asking something far more innocent, and far more survivable were the answer to be negative: might you be free on Friday? And we can survive because, even though we once got terribly hurt in the nursery, we are now that most resilient of things: an adult. So we have many other options, we won't (as we once feared) die of loneliness if it doesn't work. We can take our time, we can allow things to emerge, we can tolerate ambiguity. And with such security in mind, we can begin to do that most momentous of things: without risking our sanity, see if someone we like might – after all -want to go out tonight Our online shop has a range of books and gifts that address the most important and often neglected areas of life.

    "Title": "Can People Change?",
    "Transcript": "'Can people change?' The question may sound somewhat abstract and disinterested, as if one were asking for a friend or for the universe, but it is likely to be a good deal more personally – and painfully – motivated than that. We ask, typically and acutely, when we're in a relationship with someone who is inflicting a great deal of pain on us: someone who is refusing to open their hearts or can never stop lying, someone who is aggressive or detached, someone who is harming themselves or managing to devastate us. We ask too because the one immediately obvious response to frustration isn't in this case open to us: we're not able to simply get up and go, we are too emotionally or practically invested to give up, something roots us to the spot. And so, with the example of one troublesome human in mind, we start to wonder outwards about human nature in general, what it might be made of and how malleable it could turn out to be. One thing is likely already to be evident to us: even if people can change, they certainly don't change easily. Maybe they flare up every time we raise an issue and accuse us of being cruel or dogmatic; maybe they break down late at night and admit they have a problem but by morning, vehemently deny that there could ever be anything amiss. Maybe they say yes they get it now, but then don't ever deploy understanding where it really matters. We can at best conclude that by the time we've had to raise the question of change in our minds, someone around us has managed not to change either very straightforwardly or very gracefully. We might ask a prior question: is it even OK to want someone to change? The implication from those who generate trouble for us is, most often, an indignant 'no'. 'Love me for who I am' is their mantra. But considered more imaginatively, only a perfect human would ever deny that they might need to grow a little in order more richly to deserve the love of another. For the rest of us, all moderately well-meaning and half-way decent requests for change should be heard with goodwill and in certain cases acted upon with immense seriousness. Those who bristle at the suggestion that they might need to change are – paradoxically – giving off the clearest evidence that they may be in grave need of inner evolution. Why might change be so hard? It isn't as if the change-resistant person is merely unsure what is amiss, and will manage to alter course once an issue is pointed out – as someone might if their attention were drawn to a strand of spinach in their teeth. The refusal to change is more tenacious and willed than this. A person's entire character may be structured around an active aspiration not to know or feel particular things; the possibility of insight will be aggressively warded off through drink, compulsive work routines, or offended irritation with all those who attempt to spark it. In other words, the unchanging person doesn't only lack knowledge, they are vigorously committed to not acquiring it. And they resist it because they are fleeing from something extraordinarily painful in their past that they were originally too weak or helpless to face – and still haven't found the wherewithal to confront. One isn't so much dealing with an unchanging person as, first and foremost, with a traumatised one. Part of the problem, when one is on the outside, is realising what one is up against. The lack of change can seem so frustrating because one can't apprehend why it should be so hard. Couldn't they simply move an inch or two in the right direction? But if we considered, at that moment, the full scale of what this person once faced, and the conditions in which their mind was formed (and certain of its doors bolted shut), we might be more realistic and more compassionate. 'Couldn't they just…' would not longer quite make sense. At the same time, very importantly, we might not stick around as long as we often do. We should at this juncture perhaps ask ourselves a question that may feel at once unfair and rather tough: given how clear the evidence is of a lack of change in a certain person, and hence of a lack of realistic hope that our needs are going to be met any time soon, why are we still here? Why are we trying to open a door that can't open and returning to a recurring frustration and hoping for a different result? What broken part of us can't leave a lack of fulfilment alone? What bit of our story is being re-enacted in a drama of continuously dashed hopes? And, if we are talking of change, might we one day change into characters who don't sit around waiting without end for other people to change? Might we become better at sifting through options and allowing through only those who can already meet the lion's share of our needs? In addition, might we become better at deploying a dash of life-sustaining ruthlessness in order to leave those who tirelessly rebuff us? We may need to rebuild our minds in order – with time – to change into people who don't wonder for too long if, and when, people might change."

    "Title": "On Disliking Oneself",
    "Transcript": "There is one particularly salient question we should ask in order to measure our levels of emotional well-being: do you broadly feel that you have the right to exist and are, on balance, a good enough human being? Or, whatever your outward circumstances and achievements, do you generally feel you are a piece of excrement, who has only got through life by deluding others (who would quickly abandon you if they knew even a fraction of the truth about you) and, because you are a liar, are only ever one or two steps away from deserved humiliation and catastrophe? It is in a sense extraordinary how many of us instinctively answer yes to the second question; in other words, how many of us are alive without a sense that we have any genuine merit in walking the earth. Suicide statistics say something horrifying about our societies, but the numbers on violent self-hatred, from which one in four of us are estimated to suffer, say something arguably even worse. If we saw a stranger being treated the way many of us treat ourselves, we wouldn't hesitate to call it wanton cruelty. An odd detail about disliking oneself is that one generally doesn't even notice oneself doing it. Realising it would require a degree of objectivity about one's potential worth that one precisely lacks. Self-hatred can be too obvious to be visible; it's the default position and has been since childhood. One doesn't identify as a self-disliker; one just thinks one's a piece of shit. The feeling radiates its effects in a number of areas: if someone pays you a compliment, you immediately doubt their intelligence. When someone offers to love you, you wonder why they are so weak. When you are stuck in a frustrating relationship, at work or in private life, you stay (if necessary for decades), for this is - after all - simply what you deserve. If you're promoted or are admired, you at once feel incapable and a liar. There's a voice in your head that accompanies you in all challenges and tells you that won't be able to do this, that you're a moron and everyone hates you. If something appears to go well, you'll sabotage things brilliantly. You know just how to screw up job opportunities and drive away people who want to be kind. You easily feel that people are mocking and mistreating you: you sense hostility in interactions in shops or restaurants, with colleagues or lovers, a lot of the time, you're in a paranoid frame of mind - out of a fear that the world might at any point discover or has already discovered what you well know about yourself: that you're a disgusting imbecile. Salvation starts with an obvious sounding insight that should nevertheless be written in large letters across the sky: no one is born liking themselves. That is, there's a history to this which you've been left unable to think about. It is only the soothing, enthusiastic responses of our earliest caregivers that can lend any of us encouragement to carry on. Our sense of self is assembled out of the reactions of those who were first around us. We may not know anything about these people in conscious memory but we don't need to. We can deduce everything vital by asking ourselves the very simple question: Do I like who I am? You may not have the original mould at hand, but you can sense the imprint in the dough of your character. No one can survive the sense that they were a bore, a threat, an inconvenience or a disappointment to those who made them. This isn't a negotiable point. If you were in this wretched camp, you get a prize for not having done away with yourself already. We can't escape a basic law: we are the only animal whose sense of being able to keep on keeping on depends on the welcome accorded to them by those who made them. It's so horrific to have to acknowledge that we were badly or unfairly treated, in an especially bizarre phenomenon we're liable to turn the anger we might in theory feel towards our erstwhile flawed caregivers back onto ourselves. We end up preferring to dislike who we are rather than accepting a yet more horrible idea: that someone we needed to adore wasn't very nice to us. We can end up lacking any capacity for anger, for that would require a basic sense of self-worth and therefore an idea that we had been violated. Most of us are just numb. Or, in an effort to numb, we gorge on drugs, porn, love affairs, fame or processed sugar… The path of self-hatred points everywhere other than its real source: those early years. How does one ever dig oneself out of the mine-shaft of self-hatred? For a start, by becoming a better historian of our selves - and therefore being able to hold on to the idea that we hate ourselves only or primarily because we were once not loved. This has a structure so basic it feels like an insult, but to make the concept resonate with one's actual experience can be the task of a lifetime. We need to start to notice what unfair story tellers we are: how many decades of practice we have had at always turning ourselves into the villain, of justifying the behaviour of others way beyond what they deserved and at putting ourselves invariably at shameful fault. We may be very clever, but in this area, we probably can't think too clearly - so we may need to bring in another brain to help our faltering one out. We may need to check our reality against another's and thereby recalibrate our assessment of everything we've touched. We need to repatriate the pain: away from hating ourselves and fearing the world towards mourning an original catastrophe. We may eventually reach a very weird-sounding insight: that we aren't exceptionally awful, we just had an exceptionally unfortunate introduction to existence. We need to learn a vital art, from which so much else good can then flow: that of being on our own side. Visit our shop to give a life-changing gift.

    "Title": "The One Question We Need to Ask Ourselves When We Feel Anxious",
    "Transcript": "One of the most difficult features of anxiety is that it tends to be all-consuming. It squats in the middle of our minds and refuses to let anything else in or through. Though the anxiety causes us great pain, it denies any attempts to be questioned, analysed, probed or reconfigured. We are both terrified and unable to think beyond our terror. Our thoughts become low, relentless, repetitive, stymied things: returning again and again to the issue of whether the door is locked, the accounts were signed off or the social media account is not under attack. Anxiety dominates over and excludes any other form of mental activity; all that will be in our minds is terror. Impregnable and bullying, anxiety in effect shuts down our central faculties. But there is one nimble way to try to outwit anxiety – and that is with a question that recognises a fundamental feature of anxiety: that it is frequently a smokescreen for something else, something beyond what we consciously think is worrying us, that we're in fact concerned with or sad about. One of the peculiar facets of our minds is that we may choose to feel anxious rather than to confront things that may be yet more painful or emotionally awkward in our lives. It can be easier to fret than to know ourselves properly. We might feel anxious about whether we're going to get to the airport on time as an escape from the greater challenge of wondering whether this holiday is even worth it and whether our spouse still loves us. Or we might get intensely anxious about a financial issue in order to avoid a yet trickier acknowledgement of our confusion at the course of our emotional lives. Or we may develop a sexual anxiety as an alternative to thinking about our sense of self-worth and the childhood that destroyed it. Panic may be invited to shield us from more profound sources of self-aware agony. And yet, of course, we are always better off getting to the root cause of our troubles, rather than filling our minds with diversionary panic – and in order to do so, we would be wise at points to ask ourselves a simple but possibly highly revealing question: 'If your mind wasn't currently filled with these particular anxious thoughts, what might you have to think about right now?' The question, as simple in structure as it is acute in design, is liable to unlock a moment of original insight. The answer might go like this: – I might realise how sad and lonely I am… – I might realise how angry I feel towards my partner… – I might realise how abandoned I feel… And that, of course, is precisely what we should be doing now. Filling our minds with, and processing, all the stuff that our anxiety was trying to keep at bay. Certain anxieties can be taken at face value, for they do clearly relate to worrying things in the world. But there is another class of them, and a rather large one at that, that is there for no better purpose than to distract us from understanding important parts of ourselves. If we need to suffer, and often we will, the least we can do is to ensure that we are suffering for the right reasons. At points, we should trade our anxiety in for something far more important: a confrontation with the real ambivalence and complexity of our lives – and we should do so thanks to a naively simple question: 'If your mind wasn't currently filled with these particular anxious thoughts, what might you have to think about right now?' Our Wisdom Display Cards explore what it really means to be wise and how we can strive to become more enlightened in our everyday lives."

    "Title": "How to Test Your Emotional Maturity",
    "Transcript": "One of the more puzzling aspects of the way we're built is that our emotional development does not necessarily or automatically keep pace with our physical growth. We can be fifty-five on the outside and four and a half in terms of our impulses and habitual manner of communicating – just as we can be on the threshold of adulthood physically while an emotional sage within. In order to assess our own and others' emotional development, we can make use of a single deceptively simple question that quickly gets to the core of our underlying emotional 'age'. When someone on whom we depend emotionally lets us down, disappoints us, or leaves us hanging and uncertain, what is our characteristic way of responding? There are three methods which indicate emotionally immature behaviour (we might grade ourselves on a scale of 1-10 according to our propensities). Firstly: we might sulk. That is, we simultaneously get very upset while refusing to explain to the person who has upset us what the problem might be. The insult to our pride and dignity feels too great. We are too internally fragile to reveal that we have been knocked. We hope against hope that another person might simply magically understand what they have done and fix it without us needing to speak – rather as an infant who hasn't yet mastered language might a hope a parent would spontaneously enter their minds and guess what was ailing them. Secondly: we might get furious. Another response is to get extremely, and disproportionately angry with the disappointing person. Our fury may look powerful, but no one who felt powerful would have any need for such titanic rage. Inside, we feel broken, at sea and bereft. But our only way of reasserting control is to mimic an aggrieved emperor or taunted tiger. Our insults and viciousness are, in their coded ways, admissions of terror and defencelessness. Our pain is profoundly poignant; our manner of dealing with it a good deal sadder. Thirdly: we might go cold. It takes a lot of courage to admit to someone who has hurt us that we care, that they have a power over us, that a key bit of our life is in their hands. It may be a lot easier to put up a strenuous wall of indifference. At precisely the moment when we are most emotionally vulnerable to a loved one's behaviour, we insist that we haven't noticed a slight and wouldn't give a damn anyway. We may not simply be pretending: remaining in touch with our wounds may have become conclusively intolerable. Not feeling anything may have replaced the enormous threat of being fully alive. These three responses point us in turn to the three markers of emotional maturity: Firstly, the Capacity to Explain. That is, the power – simple to describe but a proper accomplishment in practice – to explain why we are upset to the person who has upset us; to have faith that we can find the words, that we are not pathetic or wretched for suffering in a given way and that, with a bit of luck, we will find the words to make ourselves understood by someone whom we can remember, deep down, even at this moment of stress, is not our enemy. Secondly, the Capacity to stay Calm. The mature person knows that robust self-assertion is always an option down the line. This gives them the confidence not to need to shout immediately, to give others the benefit of every doubt and not to assume the worst and then hit back with undue force. The mature like themselves enough not to suspect that everyone would have a good reason to mock and slander them. Thirdly, the Capacity to be Vulnerable The mature know, and have made their peace with the idea, that being close to anyone will open them up to being hurt. They feel enough inward strength to possess a tolerable relationship with their own weakness. They are unembarrassed enough by their emotional nakedness to tell even the person who has apparently humiliated them that they are in need of help. They trust – ultimately – that there is nothing wrong with their tears and that they have the right to find someone who will know how to bear them. In turn, these three traits belong to what we can call the three cardinal virtues of emotional maturity: Communication, Trust and Vulnerability. These three virtues were either gifted to us during a warm and nourishing childhood or else we will need to learn them arduously as adults. This is akin to the difference between growing up speaking a foreign language, and having to learn it over many months as an adult. However, the comparison at least gives us an impression of the scale of the challenge ahead of us. There is nothing to be ashamed of about our possible present ignorance. At least half of us weren't brought up in the land of emotional literacy. We may just never have heard adults around us speaking an emotionally mature dialect. So we may – despite our age – need to go back to school and spend 5 to 10,000 hours learning, with great patience and faith, the beautiful and complex grammar of the language of emotional adulthood. our emotional barometer is a tool that can help us to more clearly explain our moods.

    "Title": "A Short Introduction To Philosophy | The School of Azzyland",
    "Transcript": "Didn't I ask for a cocktail? PRODUCER: Three, two, one, action. NARRATOR: AzzyLand presents most of what you need to know about philosophy in around five minutes. The word philosophy tells us why the subject matters. It's originally a word from Ancient Greek. The first part, \"philo,\" means love. The second part \"sophia\" means wisdom. So, philosophy means, quite literally, \"The love of wisdom.\" But what does wisdom mean? NARRATOR: Let's begin at the beginning, shall we? Plato. For Plato, the essence of living a wise life came down to the command, \"To know yourself.\" His big idea was that our lives so often go wrong because we don't give ourselves time to think carefully and logically. Meaning that we often end up with the wrong values, careers and relationships. I want to marry the princess. You? Marry the princess? [LAUGHING] AZZYLAND: Plato observed how proud people were about their instincts, making snap decisions based on how they felt. He compared this to being dragged along by a group of blindfolded wild horses. [HORSE NEIGHS] NARRATOR: Daoism. AZZYLAND: Daoism, or \"The Way,\" is based on the concept of wu wei, which means \"non-doing\" or \"doing nothing.\" But it doesn't mean being lazy. Wu wei is connected to reverence for the natural world. We should behave like bamboo that bends in the wind or the plant that adjusts itself to the shape of a tree. Instead of trying to force things, we must put our egos aside to be at one with the environment. We can be like water, which is submissive and weak, but it has the power to wear down what is hard and strong. NARRATOR: Stoicism. Stoicism flourished for around 400 years in Ancient Greece and Rome. But it's still a useful guide for teaching us how to be calm and brave in these uncertain and anxious times. What we need to do is systematically and intelligently crush every last vestige of hope. It is far better, the Stoics proposed, to courageously come to terms with every worst possibility and then make ourselves entirely at home with them, embracing what could happen if our worst fears came true. We would cope. Vogue break! [MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: Machiavelli. Machiavelli said, wicked people use lies, threats and violence to get their way. And that's why they rule the world. Machiavelli's most famous book... The Prince. [DRUMROLL] The Prince gave advice to princes, who ran things in those days, on how to get things done. The Prince was not a guide to being a tyrant. It's a guide about what nice people need to learn from tyrants, so they can be effective. [SNAPS] Manstool? NARRATOR: Nietzsche. Nietzsche's boldest assertion was that God is dead and we killed him. This was not some kind of boast. Nietzsche thought that religious beliefs are very useful. And he called for a reformation in which people would fill the gaps created by the disappearance of religion with the wisdom and healing beauty of culture. NARRATOR: Existentialism. The Existentialists focused on the agony of choice. They asked us to reject the delusion that perfection is within reach. That sinking feeling that we had that option to choose correctly, but failed, is an illusion. Disappointment is just an inevitable characteristic of the human condition. [EXHALES] [LAUGHS] Philosophy used to be [BLEEP] cool, with people like Socrates out in the streets in Ancient Greece asking people real questions and discussing [SNAPS] big ideas. Over time, those big ideas have become stuck in universities and debated by people with no interest in actually improving the world. But the Internet is turning the tables and philosophy is back, baby, with ordinary people asking deep questions in discussions just like this one. Right here, on YouTube. NARRATOR: So, now that you've had a crash course in what philosophy actually is, catch up on the rest of the series, as some of YouTube's most popular creators tackle some of philosophy's most intriguing ideas, right here, on The School of Life.

    "Transcript": "You work for me. We're gonna make a lot of money today. We're gonna make you some money today. If you guys don't, you're fired. [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: The School of Life<i> is sending</i> <i> some of</i> YouTube's<i> most popular creators</i> <i> on a series of field trips</i> <i>to explore some philosophy's most intriguing ideas.</i> <i> This time, good friends</i> <i> Hannah Stocking and Anwar Jibawi</i> <i>two LA-based content creators</i> <i> best known for their comedy skits</i> <i> and with a fan base</i> <i> of over ten million subscribers between them,</i> <i> asked, \"If capitalism has reached</i> <i> the end of the road,</i> <i> and, if it's broken, what kind of system might replace it?\"</i> Anwar, what do you know about capitalism? Capitalism, well, here's the thing. Capitalism is um... NARRATOR:<i> A 60-second guide to capitalism.</i> <i> For thousands of years, the rich were rich</i> <i> because they owned land</i> <i> and the poor were poor because they didn't.</i> <i>With no opportunities to change their circumstances,</i> <i> nobody questioned their place</i> <i> or hatched elaborate schemes to get rich quick.</i> <i> But, in the 1500s, a scientific and technological</i> <i> revolution swept through Europe.</i> <i> Over the next 500 years,</i> <i> fortunes were made from a new capitalist system,</i> <i>based on the spiraling profits that could be reaped</i> <i>from an ever growing cycle of production and consumption.</i> <i> But capitalism also created a new moral choice,</i> <i> because as the wealth of the few grew,</i> <i> so, too, did the suffering of the poor,</i> <i>as they labored in the new factories in cities</i> <i> they flocked to looking for work.</i> <i> We could either be rich or virtuous.</i> <i> Profit relied on exploiting workers</i> <i> and selling people things they didn't need.</i> <i>While being thrifty and honest meant a life of poverty.</i> <i> The choice between profit and purpose</i> <i> is more urgent</i> now<i> than ever.</i> <i> As a soaring population</i> <i> consumes increasingly scarce resources,</i> <i> provoking a striking new question.</i> <i>Could the future of capitalism look a lot like socialism?</i> <i> We asked Hannah and Anwar to investigate</i> <i>some of the pluses and minuses of capitalism and socialism,</i> <i> by running rival cake stalls</i> <i> according to the principles of each</i> <i> at the Grand Central Market at downtown Los Angeles.</i> <i> Hannah's stall is driven by key capitalist principles,</i> <i> an overwhelming concern for profit,</i> <i> prioritizing the needs of consumers</i> <i> over those of the workers,</i> <i> and clever marketing to stimulate desire.</i> HANNAH: If somebody's gonna buy a cupcake, they're gonna want edible sparkles and gold flakes on it. And deliciousness. Anybody want some cupcakes, five dollars only. NARRATOR:<i> Anwar's cake stall</i> <i> is governed by key socialist principles.</i> <i> Because profit seems to rest upon exploitation,</i> <i>the only goal is to break even,</i> <i> prioritizing the needs of the workers</i> <i> over those of consumers,</i> <i> providing customers with only the basics.</i> Our cupcakes are three dollars. ANWAR: Cool. Agreed? -ANWAR: Cool. Awesome. -Works for me. NARRATOR:<i> A long standing argument</i> <i> between capitalism and socialism</i> <i>hangs on a heated disagreement over three key concepts.</i> <i> Profit, competition and happiness.</i> <i> In capitalism, people use their money</i> <i>to start businesses, or lend their money to others</i> <i> expecting to make a return on it.</i> <i> Socialists say that the search for profit</i> <i> inevitably exploits the workers,</i> <i> by not paying them decently</i> <i> or by making them work too hard.</i> We're gonna make you some money today. You guys don't, you're fired. You gotta work hard enough to get rewarded. Why do you think parents give you chores and then money at the end of the day? You have to work for the money. That makes sense. But there's a limit. We're not trying to rip anyone off. What if we don't sell? Don't worry, you'll still get paid. Yeah. NARRATOR:<i> But capitalists say</i> <i> that in the drive to make money,</i> <i> they become focused on customer satisfaction,</i> <i> in a way that socialists rarely are.</i> <i> We have four flavors. All of them are $5 each.</i> Five bucks? That's so much money. -It's probably the best cupcake you'll ever have. -Okay. NARRATOR:<i> This is the paradox that capitalism's earliest analyst, Adam Smith,</i> <i> called the invisible hand of the market,</i> <i> whereby capitalism forces the most selfish people</i> <i> to think about the needs of others.</i> <i> Not because they're kind,</i> <i> but in order to drive up profits.</i> <i>Out of selfishness, business will be super-attentive</i> <i> and, in a way, kind to customers.</i> Thank you guys, so much, for your business. NARRATOR:<i> In a deep sense, greed is good,</i> <i> or at least it may do good.</i> <i>Capitalists believe that humans are lazy, risk-averse creatures</i> <i> who naturally take the easy road,</i> <i> and won't invent or invest unless forced to</i> <i>by the threat of someone else grabbing their profits.</i> We're gonna go get something to eat. Can you watch my stand, please? -What? -Yeah, is that cool. Thank you. ANWAR: Let's go. NARRATOR:<i> A so-called free market</i> <i> is essential because only competition</i> <i> creates an incentive for people to innovate</i> <i> and make their products and services better.</i> HANNAH: People are just naturally drawn to ours, which is gold, balloons, signs, boys yelling. And over there... NARRATOR:<i> Socialists will say that the free market</i> <i> leads to further exploitation of workers</i> <i>as firms undercut each other on price</i> <i> by pushing down wages and conditions.</i> Arman, I don't know if I could afford to keep you here any longer, so we're gonna need to send you home early. You want me to go home, right now? HANNAH: Right now. Yeah. NARRATOR:<i> Socialists prefer</i> <i> the opposite of the free market.</i> <i> A monopoly: one cake stand for everyone.</i> <i> Which is the very thing that capitalists say leads to stagnation</i> <i>and the failure to provide value for customers.</i> My workers obviously love me way more than they loved you. Yeah. You're a popular boss, but you're not gonna be popular when you run out of business. NARRATOR:<i> Socialists argue that profit relies</i> <i> on selling people things</i> <i> that they desire but don't need.</i> <i> Things like exotic fruits, expensive wines and cupcakes.</i> <i> Socialists prefer a simple economy</i> <i> based on needs, not desires.</i> We've got red velvet, chocolate, double chocolate. -Guys, you want some cupcakes? -[GIRLS SCREAMING] She's profiting off everyone here. ANWAR: And she's ripping everyone off. NARRATOR:<i> Capitalists would say that in a basic economy,</i> <i> where people only buy what they really need,</i> <i> most businesses would quickly go bust</i> <i> and tax revenues would collapse.</i> <i>Everyone would suffer, especially the most vulnerable.</i> <i> Capitalists don't think we desperately</i> need<i> fancy cupcakes.</i> <i> But the surplus generated</i> <i> from this kind of unnecessary expenditure</i> <i> is what creates the wealth</i> <i> which pays for things like schools and old people's homes.</i> <i> It seems we face a choice.</i> <i> A free market economy driven by profit,</i> <i>which strives to please customers but exploits workers,</i> <i> or the workers who do well can be richly rewarded...</i> So, here's your wages and here's your bonus. Thank you so much, boss. Thank you for making me money. NARRATOR:<i> ...or a tightly controlled economy</i> <i> focused on satisfying basic needs,</i> <i> where workers are put ahead of customers,</i> <i>but where a lack of competition</i> <i> means that there's never enough profit</i> <i> to escape from poverty or innovate properly.</i> -This is for you. -Thank you. -This is for you. -Thank you. This is for me. Cheers. WOMAN: Cheers. [LAUGHS] NARRATOR:<i> Part of the problem</i> <i> is that the capitalism versus socialism debate</i> <i> is often presented as an \"either-or.\"</i> I think both are good in their own ways. I just think that if we get little parts from each system, there's a good way of finding, like, a middle ground, you know. Think you're onto something, Anwar. Yeah. NARRATOR:<i> Perhaps both sides</i> <i> need to steal each other's best lines.</i> <i> From socialism, capitalism should steal...</i> <i> And from capitalism, socialism should steal...</i> <i> What else might each side learn from the other?</i> <i>Tell us in the comments below.</i> I hope you guys enjoyed watching this film.

[THEME MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR:<i> The School of Life is sending</i> <i> some of YouTube's most popular creators</i> <i> on a series of field trips,</i> <i>to explore some of philosophy's most intriguing ideas.</i> <i> This time...</i> <i> ♪ I be the one they love I be the don</i> <i> ♪ They know where I'm from</i> <i> ♪ 01 to the 21, yo bredrin</i> <i> ♪ Where has your hairline gone? ♪</i> <i> Lady Leshurr, a rapper and content creator</i> <i> is taking time out from her day job</i> <i> to show that the great thing about democracy</i> <i> is that absolutely anyone can run for office.</i> <i> And the terrible thing about democracy</i> <i> is that absolutely anyone could end up in power.</i> LADY LESHURR:<i> I'm at a school in South London.</i> I'm about to go into a mini election. <i> And I'm trying to get the kids to vote for me,</i> to get me into power. Before we get started, here's a short guide to democracy. NARRATOR:<i> A 60-second guide to democracy.</i> <i> Democracy is the most perfect system of government ever invented.</i> <i> It's also delivered some of the worst decisions ever made.</i> <i> It was the ancient Greeks who had the democracy light-bulb moment.</i> <i> But Socrates,</i> <i> one of its most famous thinkers,</i> <i> thought it was a stupid and dangerous idea.</i> <i> Because the choice made by the people</i> <i> could only ever be as good</i> <i> as the intelligence and education of the people.</i> <i> Would you want the course of a ship you were sailing on</i> <i> to be decided by an experienced sea captain</i> <i> or left off to everyone</i> <i> who just happened to be onboard, he asked.</i> <i> Good point.</i> <i> Because while a properly-operated democracy</i> <i> would always deliver the result that the majority wants,</i> <i>whether that's the right result</i> <i>is another question entirely.</i> <i> After all, we're flawed and fickle beings</i> <i> who can easily be bribed, tricked or charmed</i> <i> into choosing things which are bad for us.</i> <i> And in an age of fake news, social media and big data,</i> <i> that's truer now than ever.</i> <i> So, might it be better if we weren't calling all the shots?</i> <i> You decide.</i> <i> Actually, maybe don't.</i> <i> Democracy is a great idea in theory.</i> <i>But the quality of the outcome</i> <i> depends on the voters understanding the choices they're making.</i> It's the hype in the buzz of a party that will make people be persuaded. <i> A lot of things are based on popularity.</i> <i> It's a popularity contest.</i> But I've got a few tricks up my sleeves to persuade them. NARRATOR:<i> In her bid for power,</i> <i> Lady Leshurr will be going head-to-head</i> <i> against the people who know the children best,</i> <i> their teachers.</i> <i> Head of Maths, Mr. Beazley.</i> <i> And head of languages, Ms. Smerald.</i> Now is the time where we actually have to meet our political rival. [CHILDREN CHEERING] NARRATOR:<i> The kids have no reason to think that Lady Leshurr,</i> <i> a rapper with zero experience of running a school,</i> <i> will be a better candidate than their teachers.</i> <i>But on the level playing field of democracy,</i> <i> both she and her rivals</i> <i> will be presenting their manifestos.</i> <i> Up first is Mr. Beazley.</i> ...education is the most important factor in shaping young people's lives. So, we will continue setting regular homework, -so that you can continue learning... -[CHILDREN EXCLAIMING] ...even when you're at home. -[CHILDREN BOOING] -[LADY LESHURR LAUGHING] -That's boring. -[CHILDREN LAUGHING] I want to give you guys no uniforms. [CHILDREN CHEERING LOUDLY] I want you guys to have your phone on deck whenever you want. [CHEERING LOUDLY] NARRATOR:<i> Next up for the teachers, Ms. Smerald.</i> ...English, maths, science. As the world changes, they are more important than ever. [CHILDREN BOOING] [LADY LESHURR LAUGHING] LADY LESHURR: I want more exciting lessons. So, instead of maths, why don't we replace that -with a gaming room. -[INAUDIBLE ] Instead of art class, we're going to do make-up. [CHEERING] BEAZLEY: We will be providing extra tutorials with teachers, even during breaks -and after school. -[CHILDREN BOOING LOUDLY] LADY LESHURR: And last but not least, I feel we need longer breaks for you people. Later starts and earlier finishes. -GIRL: Yeah! -What does that sound like? [CHILDREN CHEERING LOUDLY] If this is a better option to these guys, then please vote for me. [CHEERING] NARRATOR:<i> With manifestoes presented,</i> <i> the campaign can begin.</i> <i> Lady Leshurr is running a fresh, colorful, glossy campaign</i> <i> which focuses on style over substance.</i> <i> This is in total contrast to the teachers' approach.</i> LADY LESHURR:<i> Just giving the kids couple of t-shirts and lollipops,</i> <i> I can persuade them to vote for me.</i> <i> So, goes to show it's a popularity contest.</i> So, everybody gets one vote. NARRATOR:<i> We like to believe that we are rational beings</i> <i> who make only logical decisions.</i> <i> But election results are affected by a range of factors</i> <i> that show we can be anything but rational.</i> <i> All the votes are in and counted.</i> <i> Who have the kids decided to elect?</i> Right, this is the moment you've all been waiting for. A hard-fought election campaign. I'm ready to announce the winner. With 86% of the vote... -Lady Leshurr. -LADY LESHURR: Yeah! [CHEERING LOUDLY] NARRATOR:<i> Even Lady Leshurr is surprised</i> <i> by the size of her landslide victory.</i> <i> And she's keen to understand</i> <i> why so few of the children voted for the teachers.</i> Why do you think only six people voted for the teachers, though? Only six people wanted to realize that fun's later and education's now. -I know being 15, it's all about fun. -LADY LESHURR: Yeah. But those six people, they've knuckled down, and they know what they want. People our age, it's all the things we'd rather have, but we know that it's not the things that we need, even though that's the things that we want. I love that. Come on, we need to give a little clap. NARRATOR:<i> We might all be wise to think carefully</i> <i> before making our choices.</i> <i> History is full of examples</i> <i> of democratically-elected candidates</i> <i> who cast their election promises aside,</i> <i> -once they got into power.</i> -[INAUDIBLE] I've just turned up. First day that you guys have met me. You've known these teachers for years now, and a lot of you chose to side with me. And the reality is I'm not gonna give you nothing. <i> ♪ Bruh ♪</i> LADY LESHURR: I just gave you broken promises, to see how people were gonna vote for me, just giving out lollies and being funny and being more relatable. But reality is, a lot of the time, we don't know what we're voting for. NARRATOR:<i> Getting the most votes</i> <i> doesn't always mean being the best candidate.</i> <i> Too often we're left to ask, \"Did the right party win?\"</i> <i> Or just the party with the biggest party and the loudest voice?</i> [RAPPING INDISTINCTLY] [ALL CHEERING] NARRATOR:<i> There's no guarantee that the decision of the majority</i> <i> will be a good or a safe one.</i> <i> So, how can we protect ourselves</i> <i> from the dangers of democracy?</i> <i> We're not allowed to drive a car</i> <i>without passing a driving test.</i> <i> What if we had to prove that we were competent to vote?</i> <i> Then again, who would get to design the test?</i> <i> We'll leave that one for the people to decide.</i> <i> Leave your comments below.</i> LADY LESHURR:<i> I think a lot of the time</i> <i> we get influenced by our friends</i> or the people we surround our self around to give a final opinion -or judgement on something. -Yeah. Anything that seems too fun straight away, usually they don't last for long. Are you going to vote in the future? Definitely, yeah. It's my future. I love that.

    "Transcript": "So, we have six pieces of art right here. Five of them have been created by a human and one of them has been created by a machine. Which one is the machine-made piece of art? We're gonna take a vote. <i>The first one, the second one, the third one, the fourth,</i> <i> the fifth and the sixth.</i> No one got it right. NARRATOR:<i> The School of Life</i> is sending some of YouTube's<i> most popular creators</i> <i> on a series of field trips</i> <i> to explore some of</i> philosophy's most<i> intriguing ideas.</i> <i> This time, it's Luzu,</i> <i> a Spanish content creator who built a global reputation</i> <i> playing online video games</i> <i> and now has over eight million subscribers.</i> <i> Advances in artificial intelligence</i> <i> are blurring the lines between humans and machines.</i> <i>And now robots are encroaching on the last remaining area</i> <i> that we thought was uniquely human.</i> <i> The power to be creative.</i> I'm Luzu. Or am I? The one thing that I keep thinking about is, as we give these machines human-like attributes, what does that mean when it comes to our identity as humans? This is such a big subject, we need a little guide before we start. NARRATOR:<i> A 60-second guide to identity.</i> <i> For most of human history,</i> <i> the difference between humans and machines was very clear.</i> <i>A machine was something clever but simple,</i> <i> whereas humans were</i> miraculous creatures of<i> astonishing potential.</i> <i> But very recently,</i> something extraordinary<i> has happened.</i> <i>We've started to make machines</i> that equal and outstrip many<i> of our own capacities.</i> <i> This has created a troubling question.</i> <i> What is left that makes us distinctively human?</i> <i> One important answer is the ability to create.</i> <i> Machines might be better at predicting the weather,</i> <i> or even beat us at chess,</i> <i> but surely they'll never be able to generate amazing art.</i> <i> In 1950, Alan Turing,</i> the founding father<i> of computer science,</i> <i> proposed a test.</i> <i> When a human can no longer tell</i> <i> if they are interacting with a person or a machine,</i> <i> we will have lost the one last quality</i> <i> that distinguishes us from machines.</i> <i>So, when we can no longer tell</i> <i> the difference between art made by machines</i> <i> and art made by humans,</i> <i> what would be left to mark us out as unique?</i> <i> Might as soon be nothing at all</i> <i> that we can do that</i> a machine won't be able<i> to do just as well?</i> <i>Or, most frighteningly of all, much, much better.</i> <i> Machine learning is now challenging</i> <i> our very concept of what makes humans unique.</i> <i> We're comfortable with robots performing basic skills</i> <i> that we don't want to do ourselves,</i> <i> but in this video,</i> <i> Luzu was looking at AIs that create art</i> <i> before facing a test, along with you,</i> <i> to see if he can correctly identify art</i> <i> created by a machine</i> <i> when it's up against art created by humans.</i> <i>But first, what does life look like on the AI frontline?</i> Hi, there. I'm Luzu. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. How are you? I'm great. Thanks for asking. NARRATOR:<i> This robot is called NAO.</i> <i> It looks a bit like a toy,</i> <i> but, actually,</i> it's a WiFi enabled,<i> autonomous AI</i> <i> who listens through sensors</i> and gathers information<i> from online sources,</i> <i> teaching itself through</i> a continuous process<i> of machine learning.</i> <i> NAO gives an eerie sense of how the border</i> <i> between human and machine is becoming more porous.</i> -I need to learn some lines. -[EXCLAIMS] -Don't distract me. -Oh. I'm here trying to figure out what it means to be human. Do you know anything about that? Absolutely. We robots are evolving quickly and taking on more and more of your human characteristics. We have been able to carry out straightforward tasks, but recently we have begun to educate ourselves. It's called machine learning. Think I'm gonna want to research and learn a little bit more about that. NARRATOR:<i> We humans think of</i> ourselves as the undisputed<i> masters of the universe,</i> <i> but that confidence is now being challenged</i> <i> as advances in machine learning</i> <i> close the gap between</i> what humans and computers<i> can do.</i> <i> There is one area where we feel certain</i> <i> that we do still retain a unique distinction.</i> <i> Only humans have the power to be creative.</i> <i> But what if even that skill</i> <i> could be performed by a machine?</i> <i> Before being tested</i> on his ability to spot<i> the art created by an AI,</i> <i> Luzu's on his way to UCLA,</i> <i> where an AI is teaching itself</i> <i> to create an original artwork.</i> So, this is one of the projects I wanted to show you. The concept is really to teach a machine to create a single portrait from this vast number of individual portraits. And then asking it to generate its own portrait from that. LUZU: The machine creates something original, right? It's not just imitating everything, it's creating something from scratch. GABBY: So, there's two parts of the algorithm, one of them generates an image and the other one criticizing it and gives a little bit of feedback and says, \"Actually, \"you need to make it a little bit smaller, \"or put a bit of red in this area and try again.\" So, as the process goes on, it's getting better and better. So, this shows the process of evolution, where on the left we got some of the early imagery that's generated by the machine and it starts to become more and more kind of recognizable as one of the portraits from the set. But it still has a very painterly, slightly abstract, slightly Impressionistic feel. But this was just running for 24 hours. Makes me think a little bit of how a baby learning what a person is. The machine is right now doing the same thing. The machine learning processes are so similar to our own learning processes and our creative processes. That you start to see that kind of invention and creativity happening. I think in the same way that has been happening within humans. So, the machine's kind of going through that process at an accelerated rate. NARRATOR:<i> It's one thing</i> for machines to create<i> original art,</i> <i> but is it any good?</i> <i> AI company GumGum</i> is putting art<i> made by machines</i> <i> up against art made by humans</i> <i> to see if Luzu can tell which is which.</i> We're deeply interested in computer vision and machine learning and we decided, why don't we try a Turing test? And see if humans can figure out which one's artificially generated. I know that art is very subjective and something that we would attribute to, like, humans. There's a lot of emotion, there's expression, so how does a machine choose what it's gonna paint? I mean, I can flip that back on you and say, \"How do you decide?\" -Is it based on data? -I guess... Computers are more than capable of generating art in any medium. From all these paintings, one was created by a machine? That's right, yeah... Any idea which one it might be? So, it could be any of them, right? Right. Which one is it? NARRATOR:<i> While Luzu ponders,</i> <i> why don't you have a go?</i> <i> Can you tell which one of these paintings</i> <i> has been done by an AI?</i> <i> Do you think it's one?</i> <i> Two, three?</i> <i> Four?</i> <i> Five?</i> <i> Or six?</i> If I had to take a guess, I don't know a lot about art or anything like that, but I think I would choose the first one. Just because, it looks a little bit more flat, right? I don't know, it looks like something that could be made by a machine. It's like the randomness that a machine would... Yeah, I imagine something like that. -Like zeros and ones. -Yeah, kind of. [CHUCKLES] Actually, it's this one. LUZU: Okay, I was not expecting that. The way that it works is actually by taking images like this and teaching it how to generate things of this nature. And, eventually, after you feed it enough data, you'll yield something that looks like this, that passes a Turing test, which actually blew my mind. I was so happy. The definition of creativity is to create. Doesn't say anything about being a human or a monkey or machine. So, try and answer the question where this will end, these things are just gonna keep getting bigger, faster, stronger, better, and whether the data comes from us or maybe they start learning from each other, I think it's a limitless ceiling. LUZU: Do you see that as a possible thing, we end up being the ones -learning from? -Absolutely, and the fact that you couldn't discern is a testament to that. It validates the question. NARRATOR:<i> Until recently,</i> machines from<i> the oldest cameras</i> <i> to the most modern digital scanners</i> <i> have only been able</i> to capture impressions<i> of reality</i> <i> created by humans.</i> <i> Now, machines</i> are doing something<i> far more interesting.</i> <i> They're developing</i> distinctive artistic<i> personalities</i> <i> in the same way as</i> Van Gogh, Picasso<i> or Salvador Dali.</i> <i> Machines can do simple,</i> repetitive tasks like<i> frying burgers,</i> <i> and complex ones like beating us at chess.</i> <i> But if it will soon be making art</i> <i> good enough to hang in museums,</i> <i> we may have to rethink what claims we can still make</i> <i> to have any unique or distinctive qualities.</i> <i> And decide whether to feel alarmed by</i> <i> this threat to our concept of humanity,</i> <i> or proud of having built</i> machines that will soon<i> be our equals.</i> <i> Or perhaps even our betters.</i> <i> Although they may not be quite ready</i> <i> to replace us just yet.</i> [YELPS] You were trying to go too far. Like, I know I'm not that flexible, either. [YELPS] All right, I got you. Come on, my man. -Come up, you got it? -[WHIRRING] I think you got it. Okay? You're almost there. That was amazing. Can you high five? Not there yet? Okay. Thank you, guys, so much for watching. If you enjoyed it, what can they do?

We were young. -We were young. We were young, and... and that's... that's where we started being anxious 'cause... we were down and we didn't know how to handle it. Yup. [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR:<i> The School of Life is sending</i> <i> some of YouTube's most popular creators</i> <i> on a series of field trips,</i> <i>to explore some of philosophy's most intriguing ideas.</i> <i> This time, the Martinez Twins...</i> <i> ♪ Martinez Twins ♪</i> <i> ♪ We're about to hit it ♪</i> NARRATOR:<i> ...best known for their online videos, blogs and pranks,</i> <i> are looking at anxiety.</i> <i> An issue the twins...</i> <i> have had to deal with themselves.</i> I think for us, anxiety is the biggest problem -we have right now. -Yeah. NARRATOR:<i> Anxiety has replaced depression</i> <i> as the number one mental health issue.</i> <i> For many people, it's characterized</i> <i> as overwhelming feelings of loneliness,</i> <i> inadequacy and failure.</i> <i> Magnified by social media</i> <i> with its never-ending images of unattainable perfection.</i> <i> In this video,</i> <i> we're going to discover</i> <i> how the Martinez Twins experience the situation</i> <i>that sent their anxiety levels through the roof.</i> <i> They'll discover more about what makes them anxious, and why.</i> <i> And then we'll learn some practical steps we can all take</i> <i> to help us avoid anxiety.</i> <i> But first...</i> <i> A 60-second guide to anxiety.</i> <i> We live in a time of high anxiety,</i> <i> with social media providing constant updates</i> <i> on just how much fun and success everyone else is having.</i> <i> Why is everyone else enjoying a better career,</i> <i> more friends, nicer stuff and better sex than we are.</i> <i>It's the age of ultimate FOMO.</i> <i> But there's nothing new about our constant state of anxiety.</i> <i> Being anxious is just who we are.</i> <i> Countless generations of evolution</i> <i> have favored the survival of the natural-born warrior.</i> -[MAN SCREAMS]<i> -The ones who didn't worry, got eaten by wild animals.</i> -[GROWLS]<i> -But there is an antidote,</i> <i> of sorts. Previous cultures</i> <i> could draw upon deep wells of spirituality</i> <i> to assure them that everything was fine.</i> <i> They didn't worry about every little detail</i> <i> because they believed that ultimately</i> <i> they were part of a bigger plan.</i> <i>A tiny cog in a giant machine.</i> <i> Can we rediscover that freedom from anxiety</i> <i> by letting go of our egos?</i> <i> Finding relief and even taking delight</i> <i> in the knowledge that it's not all about us.</i> <i> Accepting that we and everyone else on the planet</i> <i> are just fallible imperfect warriors</i> <i> won't stop us from being anxious,</i> <i> but could it stop us being anxious</i> <i> about being anxious?</i> EMILIO:<i> We were born in Spain</i> <i> and we started making videos on the internet,</i> having fun, and we didn't know -this was about... -...to be our life. NARRATOR:<i> Having built a following at home in Spain,</i> <i> the Martinez twins moved to America,</i> <i> to join a group of other young influencers</i> <i> who lived together in a house in Los Angeles.</i> <i> Within just three months, their fan base soared</i> <i> from 400,000 subscribers to over three million.</i> [CROWD CHANTING] Go, Martinez! Go, Martinez! NARRATOR:<i> But the environment they found themselves in</i> <i> became hugely stressful for the 17-year-olds.</i> <i> Away from home for the first time,</i> <i> barely speaking English,</i> <i>and without any family support,</i> <i> the twins experienced overwhelming feelings of anxiety.</i> <i> And moved back to Spain,</i> <i> where they stopped creating content altogether.</i> I want to say thank you to, um, our fans. -We love you guys so much. -Bye, guys. -Peace. -Peace. NARRATOR:<i> So, where does the feeling of anxiety actually come from?</i> <i> Dean Burnett is a doctor of neuroscience,</i> <i> who explains the physical origin of anxiety</i> <i>in the evolution of the brain.</i> A lot of this anxiety is down to how our brains have evolved and developed, but they've done this over millions of years. Of course, the modern world is only a few 100 years old, and our brains simply haven't had the time to develop ways to recognize and cope with modern threats, dangers and issues which cause anxiety. So, if you see the brain here, this part at the top there, that's the neocortex. That's the most complex part of the brain. That's the human part of the brain where all our imagination and planning and thinking and language comes from. That's relatively new, and evolved less than two million years ago. Whereas this part here, the limbic system in the middle, that's where the threat response comes from. That's like 50 million years old or older. That's from a time when we were primitive creatures. We were constantly encountering predators and dangers and risks. Whereas now we have taken control over the world. And as a result of this, the fundamental parts of our brain which control the fear and anxiety response, they don't really have the ability to tell the difference between -being chased by a lion... -IVAN: Mmm-hmm. DEAN: ...and the possibility of putting a video online -that people don't like and having a negative reaction. -Yeah. So, the brain responds to these things in the same way when it shouldn't. People your age are actually far more prone to anxiety because the parts of your brain which tell those fundamentals bits, \"Keep quiet, calm down,\" those are still developing. EMILIO:<i> We thought that we were the only ones...</i> -IVAN:<i> Yeah.</i> -EMILIO:<i> ...at these situations.</i> It's a common thing, like, a lot of people have it. You're not alone. NARRATOR:<i> Understanding that our brains are hard-wired to make us feel anxious</i> <i>is the first step to learning that anxiety is natural, not abnormal.</i> <i>We need to learn to accept it.</i> <i> But we also need to learn to cope with it.</i> <i> Dr. Elena Touroni is a consultant psychologist</i> <i> who specializes in treating anxiety disorders.</i> <i> Unusually, for such inseparable identical twins,</i> <i> Emilio and Ivan are taking turns to confide in Elena.</i> While we were in the US, we were working everyday. There was a lot of pressure. I don't wanna fail. And if I fail, I don't want my brother to fail. And my mind thinks, \"If you don't wanna fail, just don't do it.\" One thing that I noticed is that both you and your brother mentioned, sort of, very powerfully, this idea of wanting to get out of the situation. -IVAN: Mmm-hmm. Yeah. -Kind of run away from the situation, which is very typical of anxiety. Whenever we're feeling threatened, we want to escape. If you were able to challenge that negative thought, and giving yourself a positive message, \"Look, it will be okay.\" We've done this a few times, people really enjoy watching us. And even if something was to go wrong momentarily, you and your brother will be able to find a way to recover. It's really important not to become too worried about being worried, It's very straightforward to, kind of, get help -with feelings of anxiety. -EMILIO: Mmm-hmm. Very simple techniques, such as deep breathing, mindfulness, can make a very big difference to relieving feeling of anxiety. NARRATOR:<i> Mindfulness is the process of focusing the mind</i> <i> on experiences in the present moment,</i> <i> and one of the most effective ways of combating anxiety.</i> <i> Veronika Rakli teaches relaxation through aerial yoga.</i> <i> Can she help the twins relieve their anxieties</i> <i> by learning to experience the joy of the present.</i> VERONIKA:<i> What brought you here today?</i> -To feel safe... -VERONIKA: Okay. ...when I feel anxious. So, this is what aerial yoga can help with, to soothe the body. Sitting in hammocks helps you to feel more secure. More safe. Because you can create your own bubble around your body. It is only you, your mind, your body. You are present in the moment and you are present in the body. And how do you feel now? I feel relaxed. -I almost fell asleep. [CHUCKLES] -IVAN: Yeah. This really works. <i> 'Cause you gotta be focusing on what you're doing.</i> <i> And your mind is, like, really clear.</i> <i> And I feel great.</i> NARRATOR:<i> We can all learn to cope with anxiety</i> <i> and live calmer lives</i> <i> by doing five simple things.</i> <i> We do too much,</i> <i> and then complain that our lives are too hectic.</i> <i> But what registers as anxiety</i> <i> is often the mind's plea</i> <i> not to be continuously overstimulated.</i> <i> We all need to accept that we can't do it all.</i> <i> We need proper sleep,</i> <i> at least seven hours every night.</i> <i> News organizations speak of our need to know.</i> <i> But often we have a greater need not to know.</i> <i> There's nothing we can do about the exploits,</i> <i> disasters and triumphs of strangers we'll never meet.</i> <i> We need to switch off and concentrate</i> <i> on things closer to home that we can affect.</i> <i> Anxiety's the mind's revenge</i> <i> for all the thoughts we try to suppress.</i> <i> We need to allocate time where we have nothing to do,</i> <i> other than sift through the chaotic contents of our minds.</i> <i> Every hour of living</i> <i>requires at least ten minutes of sifting.</i> <i> It would be nice to be rich, famous and successful.</i> <i> But it might be wiser to recognize</i> <i> that a truly satisfying life</i> <i> can be had living modestly</i> <i> and far away from the maniac competition</i> <i> to win the professional status race.</i> EMILIO:<i> Being anxious made us escape from social media.</i> And that is a thing that we love to do. IVAN:<i> If this happens to you,</i> <i> I wanna say to you guys</i> -that you guys are not alone. -Yeah. IVAN:<i> This can be controlled,</i> and you can handle it and you can change it. <i> There's a new future on us.</i> <i> -We're gonna go out, we're gonna have fun.</i> -EMILIO:<i> Yeah.</i> And we're not gonna worry about worrying, which is really important. Hey, guys. If you like this episode... EMILIO:<i> ...make sure you subscribe to The School of Life channel</i> <i>to watch all the cool episodes.</i> -Right now. -Go right now. -Yes go right now! -Right now! Whoo! -Right now. -[BOTH CHUCKLING]"

    "Transcript": "NARRATOR:<i> This is Walter.</i> <i> This is Walter's human, Jessica.</i> Hello. NARRATOR:<i> This is Jessica's fridge.</i> <i> And this is a film about happiness.</i> <i> The School of Life is sending</i> some of YouTube's most<i> popular creators</i> <i> on a series of field trips to explore</i> <i> some of philosophy's most intriguing ideas.</i> <i> This time, Jessica Kellgren-Fozard</i> <i> a content creator with more subscribers</i> <i>than the population of Iceland,</i> <i> the second-happiest nation on Earth,</i> <i>is finding out what most of us</i> <i> are getting wrong about happiness.</i> [KISSES] <i> As long as humans have traveled the Earth,</i> <i> people have been motivated by one thing above all.</i> <i> -The desire to be happy.</i> -[LAUGHTER] <i> But we humans seem to have an uncanny knack</i> <i>of making ourselves miserable.</i> <i> Why? What are most of us getting wrong about happiness?</i> <i> And how could we all strive to be happier?</i> Oh, that is a tough question. NARRATOR:<i> Maybe to understand,</i> <i> we need someone with a different outlook on life.</i> <i>That's where Jessica comes in.</i> <i> Jessica suffers from nerve disorder HNPP,</i> <i> and rare auto-immune disorder MCTD.</i> <i> Which means she sometimes has to use a mobility aid.</i> I'm mostly deaf and partially visually impaired. NARRATOR:<i> Jessica doesn't let it get her down.</i> I guess that's why you've asked me to be your exhibit on happiness in this film. It's important to remember that I have the same needs and desires for happiness, just like everyone else. It's just that I faced a fair few obstacles along the way. And, I guess that's given me a unique perspective on what actually makes people happy. NARRATOR:<i> Couldn't have said it better myself.</i> <i> So what do people think is the key to happiness?</i> <i> We went on to the streets of Brighton,</i> <i> where Jessica lives, to find out.</i> Hmm. That's a good question. Financial stability, probably. A hundred grand a year, I guess. More money, and a nicer car. Probably like a Chanel bag or something, yeah. Um, enough money to travel the world. Shares in a business. Just to be able to buy a house would be, uh, would be nice. A plane. NARRATOR:<i> But are money, cars, a bag and a plane</i> <i> really what would make</i> the good people<i> of Brighton happy?</i> <i> Or might the secret of true happiness</i> <i> be a little more surprising?</i> <i> A 60-second guide to happiness.</i> <i> The belief that we have a right to happiness</i> <i> is a very modern idea,</i> <i> like Segways or selfies,</i> <i> but no one can agree what makes us happy.</i> <i>Many think that material wealth will do the trick,</i> <i>but as societies become richer,</i> <i> they tend to become more miserable.</i> <i> The ancient Greeks had</i> very different concepts<i> of happiness</i> <i> to our ideas based on what we own or how we feel.</i> <i> Aristotle defined happiness as eudaimonia,</i> <i> a state achieved by living</i> a virtuous life and doing<i> good things.</i> <i> While the Stoics believed that true happiness</i> <i> comes from not expecting very much.</i> <i> Then, in the 20th century,</i> <i> happiness became all about how we feel, not what we do,</i> <i> and when chemists discovered</i> <i>that the feeling of happiness</i> can be stimulated<i> by amphetamines,</i> <i> a billion-dollar industry was born.</i> <i>Now, happy pills like Adderall</i> <i> and anti-depressants like Prozac</i> <i> are taken by hundreds</i> of millions of people<i> every day.</i> <i> But do they actually make us happy?</i> <i> The Auschwitz survivor</i> Viktor Frankl echoed<i> the ancient Greeks,</i> <i> saying that happiness is served by selfless acts.</i> <i>The more you pursue happiness,</i> <i> the less likely it is to come to you.</i> <i> So, is happiness something we can all find</i> <i> if we just stop looking for it so hard?</i> <i> What does our happiness expert Jessica think?</i> Because I have health problems, I've had to learn to find happiness when my body is trying to bring me down. As such, I developed a pretty unique perspective on what actually makes us happy. And thus I present... [READING] [JESSICA READING] Human connection is the most vital path to happiness. <i>There's moments when we open up</i> <i> and share our mushy, vulnerable insides</i> with someone else's mushy, vulnerable insides. [JESSICA READING] Living with a disability and chronic illness, I've had many, many horrible days, when things have gone badly wrong and I've ended up in hospital in excruciating pain and the edge of dying. But that's not today. And that's really important to remember. <i> -And to celebrate...</i> -[HORN TOOTING] <i> ...the amazing things about today,</i> both big and small. Even if that's something as little as having your favorite drink. [JESSICA READING] <i> I accept my limitations, because by setting a limit,</i> <i> I also set myself free</i> <i> within that framework that I've created.</i> [JESSICA READING] Happiness might come all in a rush from a big development. <i> But it's sweeter when</i> it builds from tiny drops<i> within your day.</i> Whether that's a warm bath, a beautiful dress, a good night's sleep. [BARKS] NARRATOR:<i> Thanks, Tilly.</i> [TILLY WHIMPERS] Love doesn't have to be grand and obvious and involve a ring and marriage. <i> It can also be the simple kindness</i> <i> from one human to another.</i> By showing other people love, we show ourselves love too. [JESSICA READING] We can nourish our happiness with the love and care of personal growth. <i> Every time I develop my skills and abilities,</i> <i> I feel the warmest inner glow of pride.</i> [JESSICA READING] I find happiness in the smallest things. <i> My wife's smile, my puppies' excitement,</i> <i>a walk on the beach at sunset,</i> what could be happier than that? [LAUGHS] <i> We all have</i> pretty strange ideas<i> about happiness,</i> <i> really, don't we?</i> <i> We often strive for things that just aren't possible,</i> <i> and then get upset when they don't happen.</i> I believe that happiness should be like health. Something that we prioritize and acknowledge takes work. We've all been dealt different cards in life, but only through acceptance of our misfortunes and what we're missing can we truly see the beautiful things that we do have in life, and, goodness, isn't that lovely? So, that's my list of what makes me really, genuinely happy. But my challenge to you is to think about what that is in your own life. And then, to live it.

    "Title": "Alain de Botton on Emotional Education",
    "Transcript": "[Music] well thank you thank you very much for coming to a talk which has a really strange sounding title emotional education we're very used to the idea that we need to get educated in certain sorts of skills maths Latin geography physics accountancy but the notion that we need to be educated in our emotional functioning is very peculiar surely we know about our emotions our capacities to love and to hate to feel anxious and to feel calm to direct our lives as we would wish surely we know all that stuff we don't need an education in the pursuit of a fulfilled emotional life but let me ask you just a question to see if we can just probe that um who in this room is happy to be married but not in love married but not in love any of you happy to be married but not you know tolerating tolerating the partner he's nice as you turn towards his okay alright but what we're what we're sensing is that there is a broad consensus that you guys would like to be married and happy okay interesting who here is happy to be in a job where you're earning money but you're not fulfilled okay a few people but broadly speaking this is why you need an emotional education because you have very high expectations it's very very hard to be married and happy it's very very hard to be in a job and fulfilled not merely earning money these are new expectations that we have of our lives and yet we continue to cling to an ancient model that somehow the knack for knowing how to pull off a successful emotional life is something that we should pick up by intuition ten years ago with colleagues I started up an organization called the school of life I'm here to present a new book which is simply called the school of life an emotional education it's ten years worth of our thinking around the business of how we might become emotional adults you know how to become an adult you just eat cereal and food and and wait for time to pass and you'll an emotional adult is a different thing most of us will be pushing 300 years old before we've really got the hang of it and but it's an aspiration you know we're operating in a world in which religion no longer guides us as it once did and it's within the context of a secularizing world that I and colleague set up the school of life you know when religion first went into decline in the mid 19th century in England in other parts of Western Europe people asked where were people going to get the emotional and spiritual guidance that churches had once given and there was a legitimate sense that there was going to be trouble because we are all mortal we need consolation we're isolated we're lonely we're confused and the churches for better and for worse dispensed guidance in these areas where was that going to come from if it worked out if one worked out that the whole story the biblical story was scientifically speaking nonsense well one answer came to the fore that culture would replace Scripture and that's why there was an extraordinary boom in the development of the humanities in the 19th century giant libraries were built theaters were built university courses in the arts were started for the very first time and a huge push was made towards the idea that what we have previously been able to gain from religion we would now be able to source from the plays of Shakespeare the novels of Jane Austen the the paintings of Rembrandt or Caravaggio that these sort of things would be able to give us what previous ages it found in religion it's a lovely idea partly is why we're here today you know this is in some ways part of what we're doing by gathering but without any insult on the fantastic hosts of this festival and giant done real success of this festival broadly speaking culture has not replaced Scripture and you know this because if you show up at the Tate Modern and you go on your knees and you say I'm lost I don't know how to live I I'm confused redeem me you will be very swiftly ushered out by some guards this is simply not what you can do or we show up at the University of Oxford and you're reading philosophy say the home of the largest questions you say I don't know where I should seek guidance for the largest questions um how can I be good how can I make sure my life is properly led again they would look at you very strangely one could say that those who are the guardians of culture in our society have a certain coolness about them it's as though the sort of people who they're imagine dealing with don't wake up at 3:00 in the morning as many of us here do I hope wondering what on earth it's all about and what we meant to be doing on on this planet there's a sort of sense that most of us know how to live well the starting assumption of a school of life is of course we don't know how to live and and we need guidance now there is of course an industry devoted to guidance in this area it's called the self-help industry now being sophisticated and intelligent and cultured people all of you will have steered well clear of anything redolent of the term self-help I mean it's really it's a it's a horror term it's often associated forgive me if there are any Californians in the room with a sort of naive West Coast utopianism that covers a garish the promises are overblown there's a sort of sense of you know you can change your love life in five minutes of the perfect sex life made a million dollars in a yeah et cetera in other words overblown naive sentimental promises designed to cover up a much harder reality now the starting point of the school of life is that actually trying to tell people that life is a perfect business that can be made ideal is one of the quickest ways to depress them the best way to cheer anyone up is to tell them life is difficult for everyone we suffer all of us alone thinking that we are massively unique in our sufferings we're not they're actually what binds us together and being able therefore to say we are a broken species is the first step towards consolation and an act of friendship all religions knew this move I mean think of Buddhism the first tenet of Buddhism is life is suffering well thanks very much it goes and it goes on from there and the grimness of existence far from an ignorant of that grimness being a route to ultimate despair it's actually the birth of compassion towards ourselves and compassion towards our knowing that we are broken creatures as I say is a sort of beginning of a friendship it also makes you a nicer person imagine two people on a dinner date right they do and met each other they don't know each other well and one of them starts saying well I'm pretty perfect and the other one goes I'm pretty perfect too and my job's doing well the other one goes well you know things been going pretty great for me too insufferable a rigid insufferable perfectionism how much nicer it would be if this couple got together and they said how are you crazy I'm crazy in these ways how about your brokenness what's your brokenness look like and they were able to build friendship and and a sense of neutrality precisely on on an acknowledgment of how much in them was not perfect isn't it I should say the goal of life is not the god of emotional life should never be to try and be entirely sane there are no sane people we've done some surveys we've sent out scouts no one is saying on the earth however the best possible kind of sanity you can aim for is what we like to call sane insanity whereby you have what we might call a handle on what's wrong with you there's still something wrong with you because there's something wrong with everybody but you can describe it in eloquent and reassuring terms to those who you live near with and if you don't want to harm too much that is the best that we can do but it's a lot and this is in many ways the goal of the self-help that the school of life dispensed it were uniquely we like to think quietly pre brexit we're quite a English institution in the sense that one of the great exports of this country traditionally was always melancholy and melancholy melancholy is not sadness or despair nor is it rage and or is it bitterness it's it's it's an elegant negotiation with tragedy and I think that that's what we might be able to to aim for um we live in a cruel world and I'll tell you how cruel it is because one of the first questions that we face whenever we meet somebody new is what do you do and according to how you answer that question people are the incredibly pleased to see you or a little bit fearful and just leave you alone by the nuts and you know that you are not going to get the respect the kindness the honor that of us crave because you have not performed well enough in a very fast-moving very competitive capitalist economy and this is hardwired into us with a conscious of it or not we know that's the way it is and the opposite so I should say this um in a way we live in a world of snobs now snobbery is often associated with an old-fashioned English concern with aristocracy with titles dukedoms etc and that the snob is on the lookout for someone with certain lineage and bloodline no one's a snob like that anymore or five people on the planet the dominant form of snobbery nowadays is of course job snobbery and snobbery is any way of judging another human being whereby you take a small and arguably not central part of them and use that to come to a rigid non-negotiable verdict on who they are and so for the snob if you meet a clothes snob for example you can say to them you know my trousers are from the gap that's it you know you could be the nicest person most interesting person finished right and so you know it's now the the opposite of a snob is your mother not necessarily your mother or need my mother but but doesn't what the ideal mother she doesn't care how you're doing how you're performing she cares how you are ideally ideally but most people are not our mothers most people judge very quickly and we feel that judgment is lovely called frightening quote from George Orwell who says after 20 no one cares if you're nice or not and that captures something rather tragic you know nowadays we often hear critics saying that we live in incredibly materialistic times that never before people being so greedy and focused on acquiring money I don't think that we're living in particularly materialistic times I think we're living in times that have for a whole variety of reasons connected up emotional rewards to the possession of material goods it's not ultimately the material goods that we want it's the emotional rewards that we feel rightly that there are conduit to that we're after but we know that we can't get to them without first passing through the gate of material success and that in a way lends a certain point even see to the way in which we pursue material success and the way in which our eagerness for material and status Goods plays itself out I mean look you know to be compassionate the next time you see somebody driving by in a Ferrari don't think this is somebody you know who's very greedy think this is somebody with an unusually intense and very poignant need for love that they're expressing you know through through automotive means um many many features of society nowadays are almost designed to ramp up the tension that we feel all of us feel and that we pick up at the school of life one of those things is the notion that nowadays we live in a meritocracy now meritocracy is one of those words that politicians on left and right of the spectrum are really keen on your view at all saying that the the gold and no varner of their political efforts is to create a more meritocratic world now let's try none pick that word for a moment what do people mean by meritocracy they mean a society where those who deserve certain rewards will get them that merit will lead to certain kinds of success if you're hard-working it doesn't matter who your parents were where you went to school you should be able to get to the top um this sounds fantastic I mean who on earth would ever argue with this idea but there's a very nasty sting in the tail that carries a big psychological burden if you genuinely believe in a world in which those who get to the top deserve to get to the top you'll also be creating logically a world in which those who are at the bottom deserve to be at the bottom in other words a meritocratic worldview turns success but also failure from something that might have been a chance phenomenon to something that is determined and says a huge amount about who you are and this is very different from all other societies most other societies have ascribed what happens to a person over their life at least in part at least half to the intervention of non-human forces let's call them divine we don't have to believe in these divine forces to know that that's what previous societies so if you look at ancient Rome for example so ancient Rome had a cult of the goddess of fortune she was known as Fortuna and they were estimated to have been over 8,000 shrines and statues of Fortuna in public places across Roman Italy and the notion was that if something went right for you in your life or if you had a difficult moment coming up you would immediately go and pray and give an offering to the goddess of fortune because what happened in your endeavor was held to reside at least substantially in the hands of this goddess this goddess was represented in an interesting way she was depicted holding a cornucopia which was filled with the symbols of prosperity and success and worldly glamour so money and fruit and and medals and other such things and then in her other hand she was depicted holding a tiller and this was meant to represent a capacity to change very likely with a light touch of her hand the course of men and women's lives so she was held to be fickle have immense power over us and and distribute her favors slightly willy-nilly as the mood took her so forth the goddess of fortune a central figure we don't believe in fortune anymore we don't believe in luck anymore you pick this up in language you know in medieval English if you came across somebody who had absolutely no financial resources the word that you would use to describe them was an unfortunate literally somebody not blessed by the goddess of fortune unfortunate nowadays taking the United States what you call such a person a loser a bit of a loser and feel the punitive quality of that term loser loser is what you get when a society thinks it's running a race that that race is broadly speaking fair now what does it matter if if if this happens well not believing in luck makes life a lot tougher for example if I said you know I I published this book and it's very very good but unfortunately it's sold no copies but the problem is it's not my problem it's Fortuna the goddess of fortune has somehow not blessed my book but it's really very good you'd go no no that's not true you've done something wrong you would say how can the guy be telling me that he has value and there is no external reward for that value it's hardwired into us that's what it means to live in that period of history that historians call modernity and modernity as an idea as an ideology was thought to have begun at some point in the tail end of the 19th century and one of the first great students of the mentality of modernity was the French sociologist Emile Durkheim and has a fascinating role to play in this story because Durkheim studied many of the differences between agrarian societies and industrial societies in other words societies that live together in villages where most of the money was earned through agriculture where people believed in God and where family kinship clans were very important and he controlled started this with modern societies where people live in cities where money's earned it often in large anonymous factories where people are not connected up with large family groupings but are often isolated in romantic dyads and he contrasted these and maybe lots of fascinating observations but there was one which continues to stick out and in a way haunts the modern imagination and it's this the rate of people killing themselves in modern societies is 20 times as high as that in pre in agrarian societies in other words despite all the advantages in modernity something is a little awry and that something is was very clear to Durkheim which is modern societies ascribe people's biography solely to them you are a success you are a failure not the gods not your family not where you came from doesn't matter about any of that it's how you're performing and because of capitalism in the way it works and the fact that there must always be victims and inefficiencies that are weeded out and this is going to leave a certain number of people every year who cannot face what they've become in the eyes of others their need for respect and for honor is not going to ever be realized and and the only way out is the most tragic way that humans know look in a way a lot of what we do when we try and succeed in life is by the goodwill of other people right that's what we're trying to do we're trying to by the kindness of strangers we're trying to ensure that when we walk in a room people are not ashamed and embarrassed and look the other way we're trying to hope that when when somebody greets us there will be a certain energy to their greeting now here's the good and bad news right for those of you who are on that treadmill and many of us are you know it's a very natural path it doesn't really work it sort of works but actually you know you could be the richest person in Britain if you're obnoxious no one really wants to know you this sort of pay a certain amount of respect but not really ultimately and this is a sort of strange secret um you know the thing that really turns strangers into friends and it sounds very odd because we think it's the opposite right failure vulnerability the display of vulnerability is actually the only route to friendship you cannot become friends with any human being on the planet without showing a bit of yourself which they could use against you which they could use to humiliate you which is in some ways in the eyes of the so-called world embarrassing but that's the beginning of friendship and we almost forget about this I think we know it in our hearts but we forget about it we don't live as though that's true we live as though a shiny glossy thing is going to get us the friendship we need it's not actually it's a root it's a one-way road to isolation I want to put this idea to the test some of you know each other but some of you don't what I want you to do when I give you the signal and not any time before is I want you to turn to somebody maybe that you don't know that you haven't come here with a stranger a stranger and I want you to very briefly introduce yourself shake their hand and then I want you to do a very strange sounding thing I want you to tell them very briefly something you regret something you're ashamed of and something you're sad about something you regret something you're ashamed of and something you're sad about and we've got two minutes for this introduce yourself to a stranger now [Music] okay all right let's set let's come back let's come back into the room you're enjoying this okay um let's let's all come back let's all come back so you know thank you thank you thank you I think we have to stop it there how'd you stop with that guys help me out all right the reason why the reason why this feels good is that so many of us spend so much of the time feeling a bit weird how how many of you feel a bit weird sometimes so so so maybe maybe we've got a week maybe got a room about 150 weird people which-which oh she's quite reassuring because not hungry people can't be weird that statistics are against that a conclusion it's something else is going on the problem is that we know other people only from what they choose to tell us whereas we know ourselves from the inside so we know all the turmoil and the anxiety and the regrets and the shame we know all of that but we know other people only from what they choose to tell us and because of the way that life is set up they're sort of hi how are you doing I'm great how you doing I'm great how you doing I'm gonna kill myself how you doing fantastic um because of that culture we don't get to share enough of our inner lives and we're slowly going mad for no reason at all so if ever you feel lonely isolated vulnerable do the one thing you don't really feel like doing lean into the vulnerability and dare to believe that others are as troubled by this strange business we call life as you are a great source of relief you know we're on the edge of London part of what drives us nuts in the modern world is that we live in cities were connected constantly by social media we know so much about what other human beings are up to their achievements their triumphs their ambitions right it drives us mad all other societies other than our own had bang in the middle something mightier holier greater than human beings something non-human that was venerated and was greater than the king that was greater than all the bishops that was greater than all the noblemen and the aristocracy we've done away with that the only thing at the centre of our societies is other human beings and their triumphs and their great moments no wonder we're driven slightly crazy we need moments of relief one of the things we need more than ever almost without realizing how much we need it is the spectacle of nature not for the business of being healthy though that - it's about being psychologically healthy the great thing about nature is it doesn't care about you it doesn't care about the leadership election and brexit and the finances etc it is a nonhuman world that will endure far after our human show will have ended and it relative eise's us we have such trouble finding perspective in relation to our own troubles that's why we enjoy seeing oceans and glaciers and mighty mountains and hearing Brian Cox and looking up at the stars we need this so badly we need the stars more than they'll ever need us we need we've dogs dogs are fantastic about this the great thing about a dog is it doesn't mind how things are going at the office right all it wants to do is just play with you and you throw it a ball that comes back little children children under 4 a fantastic in this regard as well they don't mind they just care if you're gonna be nice right and and and this is extremely important so being somehow relativized ok and moving on I want to talk about self-knowledge it's a big thing that we talk about here the most central command of ancient philosophy when Socrates was said what's the one thing that everyone needs to know a philosophy he replied rather no mclee know yourself that somehow self-knowledge is at the root of being an enlightened person now I might say well surely we know ourselves because like we're ourselves so surely I know me you know why would you claim to know me because I'm me so surely I know me the weird thing is it's very very hard to achieve self-knowledge if you compared the mind it would be like a gigantic house that was plunged in darkness we don't know most of the rooms most of the rooms are bolted shut often by fear and we're somewhere in operatic in a cupboard with a little torch and that's called consciousness and occasionally will sort of shine the light and try and work out what's what's going on but broadly our grasp of ourselves is incredibly fragile and and tentative largely because or in part because the things that there are to know about us are so scary there's so anxiety inducing and unfortunately we've built a world where we can escape the business of introspection far better than we almost have ever been able to do I mean you can work out a life where you need never ever be alone what's wrong with our phones is not that we're gaming on them with all having fun on them that the problem is they don't allow us enough time with our thoughts I wonder how many of you sleep well you know there's been an epidemic of insomnia and now what is insomnia in my view insomnia is really the minds revenge for all those thoughts that you in inverted commas forgot to have in the day all those thoughts about your regrets and your longings and your shame and your desires and all those things that you carefully plotted not to ever confront are gonna come and get you in the middle of the night so if you really want to sleep think more allow more time for thought in the in the other hours of your life and and other addictions are possible addictions to news to to travel to work a lot of respectable sounding reasons why we need never explore ourselves look most childhoods have gone a bit wrong without anyone meaning for anything bad to happen most of us have a childhood which has been difficult now why on earth am i mentioning childhood at this juncture and some of you in the room might go hang on a minute he's not gonna mention that guy Freud surely we know isn't over I often get asked isn't Freud finished like that wasn't wasn't he discredited it wasn't you know and the bad news and it really really is bad news and I mentioned this is a great fan of Freud the bad news is that guys not going away the insight that he made about human emotional functioning is fundamental and will even if lots of his theories are going to be discredited or improved upon or worked upon the fundamental one which is that the way that we are as adult sits upon a base formed in childhood and that the childhood relationships the central relationships that we had with our caregivers and parental figures that these are the golden key to unlocking our emotional functioning this is not going to go away anytime soon and it's a problem it's humiliating frankly you could be 30 40 50 60 70 and you're asking me to believe that who I was at five is determining so much I'm afraid yes it really is and and the best way is not to try and run away or ridicule or scoff at this notion but to accept it on the chin and do that one thing that will get us out of merely acting out our childhood patterns and our childhood dynamics and that is understanding the more you can understand a dynamic the more you could pull the plug out of it and diffuse it you know what are some of the ways in which childhoods go wrong I'm speaking with my son in the room so block your ears Samuel okay this is one way in which childhoods go wrong you know I'm borrowing heavily here from a psychoanalyst that I'm very fond or with very keen on at the school of life his name was Donald Winnicott he was working at Paddington Green Children's Hospital in the 50s 60s and 70s made amazing progress in basically turning britain from a parent focused parenting model towards a child focused parenting model in other words that a good parent now for the first time sees the child as a human being rather than as an animal that needs to be watered and fed and the notion of being attuned to a child's needs was something Winnicott believed in very much now but he observed something very important and very interesting he argued that in the early years every child has what he called a true self and that true self is fundamentally a social appoints anti-social in other words it's not interested in being good and polite and sweet it may sometimes be good in polite and sweet but not for the sake of being good and polite and sweet it is simply an authentic being trying to figure out the world on its own terms and so sometimes that means that baby will be happy and smiley and sometimes baby will be furious and kicking and biting and wanted to kill and destroy and blow up the whole world it's so furious okay now he also observed that some caregivers cannot tolerate this there may be too depressed to on-edge their own child has might have been too difficult to allow the child that moment of primary immittance and therefore the child quite early on has to do something which is very difficult the child has to become good earlier than it should so suddenly overlaid on the true-self too quickly is layered on what Winnicott called a full self and a full self smiles and a full self does really well at school and it looks as though everything's going terrifically for the full self but it's a full self and beneath is a true self that has not had its say and such is the nature of emotional development that the true self is not going to lie quietly so a large part of the problem that we've got in the modern world is over compliance it may look as though we're living in a world of rebels we're not psychologically psychoanalytically we're often living in a world of very good boys and girls who are nurturing serious mental unwellness beneath their outward competence and and great capacity to please others because good boys and girls know exactly what other people need from them they've been doing this since early childhood they they're experts at reading what somebody walking in the office know wants from them and they know how to get an Ender and that's why they're gonna be very successful but it's difficult and some of what happens and we pick up some of this at the school of life I should say by the way school life is a real institution we're based in blooms where you can walk in they gets like a therapy there it's a center we run classes we've got ten branches around the world it's a real place you can go with your mental unwellness and it's fundamental I believe that there should be places like this many more places where we can take mental challenges now one of the things we often find is people who are having a breakdown now a breakdown is an interesting phenomenon breakdowns are terrifically inconvenient for everyone around the person having a breakdown somebody was a fantastic performer at the office or they were doing really well at university or things were going swimmingly for them and suddenly they're lying in bed they're unable to speak they don't want to eat they're furious they're catatonic they're mumbling incoherently no one knows what to do now the way we like to say it is that a breakdown is very often a prelude to a breakthrough there is something trying to break through and that something can very often be a healthy thing right it's the true self that has not had its say and very inarticulately and very inconveniently because there's the AGM coming up and there's the quarterly reports etc something is bursting through something needs to be heard and we need to give that home and we don't do it enough another psychological dynamic to watch out for psychotherapist talk they work wonderful term for this of the way in which very many of us especially if we don't understand ourselves too much are guilty of what is called transference now transference is an interesting term what it means is that you are transferring from the past ways of behaving and emotions that were suited to a very difficult early the early phenomenon and you're landing these emotions onto a part of adult life that is not actually called for it that doesn't really warrant it and let me give you example some kind of office life so let's imagine you're dealing with someone as you mention you a manager of somebody and you've got a colleague and you call them into your office you say look I really like the report it's fantastic done a really great job the last couple of paragraphs you just need to kind of tweak them because they're not quite right it's not it's not landing properly and they turn around and they go what is it about you why are you always trying to bring me down nothing that I do is ever good enough for you why do I not deserve to be here like everybody else and you want to hang on hang on and quite clearly something is coming up from a place that doesn't belong merely to that office at that point something is being transferred a sense of unworthiness a defensive structure built up probably before the age of five is surging forth 8:35 in the middle of a high-rise office with a legal case pending and and therefore I don't mean that the person's gonna be sued but as it were these a bunch of lawyers trying to figure out a sensible way forward but somehow emotions have got in the way and this is fascinating and poignant and that's why we're never as adult as we like to think that we are and those who are most adult are those who have successfully negotiated a relationship with their childhood self and particularly the more damaged or tricky parts of their childhood selves with all the unusual demands that that will make like I want to talk about love because relationships you know it's been estimated that a person's life satisfaction is dependent up to 60% on the quality of their primary relationship with another another adult very striking statistic if you gave a Martian that statistic if you said how happy humans are is dependent on the quality of their relationship they would immediately deduce that human beings must be spending at least 60 percent of their time leisure time but also work time figuring out the problems of relationships it's not like that at all if you look at the modern economy probably less than 1% of the modern economy is devoted to trying to get relationships working well very peculiar statistic given what things are like for us on the ground as it was we're living our lives and part of the reason for that is a movement of ideas called romanticism which takes hold in well it starts really the tail end of the 18th century and we're still living in what we could call a Romantic Age it starts off in the minds of poets writers and artists and it's now spread everywhere you find romanticism in pop songs in in adverts in everywhere it's permeated modern culture and Romanticism teaches us all sorts of things about relationships there to my mind poisons very often our capacity to have good relationships so we're up against a very unhelpful cultural background let me give you a few of the key ideas of Romanticism so romanticism tells us that everybody everybody has a soulmate and they're going to find them it may take a bit of time bit of heartache etcetera but eventually you'll find a soulmate and when you find your soulmate you will never disagree them with them on anything they will understand everything about you and you everything about them and they will be perfect symmetry and loneliness finally will come to an end that's all made where are you gonna find them you're not going to find them with your parents setting you are poor any kind of rational analysis they're gonna be found by instinct instinct will guide you to the best person to have 50 years of happiness a special feeling it's interesting you're in the 19th century heyday Romantic literature people were always falling in love in trains it trains a very romantic place to do you see a stranger there reading a book and you're reading a book but you're actually spying them and and they have a lovely face and poetic eyes and before you know you've reached your your station you know that this is the person so that's how you find a sensible life partner for for 50 years the other thing is romanticism coincides with the secularization of society so as the hopes and dreams that we previously invested in gaad's starts to AB so some of that energy is redirected towards human beings but we now start to call angel so we say angel' could you get some milk from the fridge and angel how are we going to go out tonight sir but the problem is angels just don't quite measure up to those lovely things painted by Piero della Francesca so we get mad and angels not quite doing what it should but anyway that's an idea of Romanticism also the notion is that when you meet your soul mate and when you find them angelic you're going to live with them forever the whole thing has to be forever if it's real it has to be forever till death do us part anything else is fake and it helped that many of the romantics died quite young so very often they'd meet and they'd fall in love and it a little bit of cough and then she Burke Ulysses would set in and and after three beautiful stupendous months the lover would die and death environmentalism very few romantics had jobs leaving a lot of time to nurture one's feelings and one's emotions go out into nature nature was a great addition and a great catalyst of love particularly waterfalls and the sky at sunset it was designed to foster these these precious emotions and then there's a feature younger people who don't speed block your ears a feature of romanticism which was very distinctive a complete union of sexes in love so whereas for centuries sex it existed in one place in love in another the romantics fused the two sexes becomes the highest expression of love and which sounds lovely until is a bit of adultery which suddenly starts to become not merely a problem but a tragedy so people are constantly killing themselves in 19th century fiction because of adultery it romanticism moves adultery from being as it were a difficulty which is undoubtedly always been to being the greatest tragedy that could ever be be known you'll be telling from my tone that I don't necessarily approve of a lot of these romantic ideas let me pick a whole briefly in just a few of them I mean the notion that you're gonna find your life partner by instinct is clearly mad and I'll tell you why back to Freud back to psychotherapy the way in which we love as adults sits on top of a base formed in childhood when we fall in love we're not falling in love for the first time we are refined in love now the reason why this often goes wrong is that the love that many of us knew in childhood though there was kindness and generosity and playfulness at times there is very often also likely to have been some more problematic dynamics there might have been distance there might have been depression they might have been a certain hostility or cynicism or brittleness whatever it may be and what happens is that in adulthood when we meet various people that we think might be good for us and that our friends might think are good for us we simply don't have that special feeling we don't have the instinct feeling our feelings are quite numb you know you'll get this when imagine you've got a friend and they've been trying to find the right person for ages so you set them up on a date so when somebody's really nice and just seems really kind of sane and solvent and kind or a little bit and then you call them up after the date and you say so how did it go did you like them and their friend goes you probe and you're like you know and they go well and maybe a little not sexy or bit boring but what these are really cover words what the friend is really trying to tell you is I'm afraid that this person you set me up with is simply too healthy to produce in me the sort of dynamics that need to be generated if I'm to feel that I'm in love the person is simply good threatens to be too nice for me in order to generate that special feeling that I need because because and one doesn't know this consciously because at some level love has become associated with forms of suffering that we don't even understand and can't even dqo that's why instant is such a bad idea we need to unpick instinct because so often it's directing us towards a recreation of a problem rather than the recreation of a of a solution other crazy things you know the romantics romantics believe that if you really love somebody you should find every part of them perfect and beautiful this is a very very strange idea I mean you know sometimes incense lovers will go love me for who I am love me for who I really am why don't you love me for who I am what a mad idea I mean who really could expect to be loved for who they no one should be loved for who they are all of us should be educated this is a difference between the ancient Greeks and the romantics the ancient Greeks also made a great play of love but for them love is a classroom love is an arena in which two people can support each other to become the best version of themselves it is not a forum in which to endorse everyone's faults willy-nilly it is a classroom love is a classroom and the point of love is to be able to teach and to learn and that is what makes a so-called good lover the good lover is a good educator okay and also good pupil this could sound very odd I mean imagine if you went home tonight and you said look at listening to this chat the funny name and he's been telling me that love is a classroom and on this basis I've drawn up a list and I'm going to be talking to you tonight for an hour and a half about your faults and tomorrow night you it wouldn't go anywhere because we don't believe very unfortunately okay so many many things are badly understood look the other thing that the romantics have very unhelpfully taught us is that if you are properly in love with somebody and they are properly in love with you they should understand you without the needs to speak that they should simply ensure it and in the early days of love don't get me wrong in the early days of love there are some touching moments you know you just met somebody at 3 weeks in and it's just beautiful you're by the riverbank and you say you know that feeling when autumn comes and there's that smell and they go I know exactly what you mean I've been there before and they just they finish your sentences and from this beautiful beginning a nightmare is born and the nightmare the nightmare is that another person can understand the contents of your mind without using that terribly cumbersome thing called language and this is a real pain is that ofcourse little children have this I mean babies will literally believe that their parents know what's going on in their minds and to some extent good parents have a good shot at guessing what's in them as because it's not gonna be that complicated either they've got the light in their eyes or they're hungry or they're thirsty or they need to go to bed so we can make good guesses of this but as an adult as a complex machine that has special taste and interior decoration in what time to leave for the airport and how you feel about a particular friend you're gonna guess this know you've got it use words unfortunately romanticism has unleashed an epidemic of sulking and what is a sulk a sulk is essentially a pattern of behavior that is set in motion when you believe that someone who loves you should understand you there are things you could explain but you're going to choose not to because you're done with explaining and they're supposed to love you so they're supposed to know so after they've violated your feelings the party let's say by doing something slightly wrong or laughing or whatever you're gonna sit in the car and they're gonna go darling what's wrong and you've got nothing and then this will carry on and you'll talk to the apartment and they'll go come on what's wrong and you do nothing and you'll put yourself into the bathroom and you'll shut the door and and they'll stop knocking at the door and they look please just tell me what I've done wrong and because you're expecting as a good romantic that they will show and understand who you are how you are lonely and what you're like as a human being in your in the finest brain as a parent might understand a child it's not gonna work there is only one way to be understood and that is through the horribly cumbersome business of language okay a few other things I want to talk to you about confidence one of the things that people come to us at the school of life with is the problem of feeling that they don't dare to do something right they don't to tell somebody that they really like that they really like them or to start a business when they really want to start a business or to leave when everyone leaves they're lacking in confidence now what what do you do this is a chronic problem also by the way they often feel like imposters they go like those guys over there they're the real guys but I think I I'm just held together by sellotape I'm I'm not real they're real and I can never be like them now if we were bless bless the west coast if we were a Californian organization we would tell people this we would tell people you're beautiful you're strong you're an amazing human being believe in yourself head out there go for it this is disastrous advice don't go down that road we tell people this when they say and just I'm terrified I've glimpsed this out of the corner of my eye I think I'm an idiot I'm just I think I might be an idiot right and you know their eyes filled with tears and and we say to them something that sounds brutal but is actually totally redemptive and compassionate we say we've got news for you you are an idiot but the good news is we're on a planet of seven billion idiots right we are that the human race is obviously mired in idiocy from beginning to end right we walk into doors we don't understand ourselves we don't start other people we make catastrophic errors we from beginning to end the whole thing is a mess right now once we accept this with a certain grace and indeed humor this is the birth of humor which is one of the most redemptive emotions we can ever have humor towards ourselves and humor towards others right once we can start to accept that of course we're idiots and that the fundamental nature of being human is idiocy you'll just go up and ask the person on a date because well you know you're an idiot and it doesn't matter they're an idiot too and off you go or you might go up and ask somebody if they might be interested in starting a business with you what does it matter life is short we're all idiots so the fundamental notion of confidence built up not through an assumption of a a perfection and our perfectibility but precisely a confidence born of an elegant negotiation with everything that is imperfect in us this seems enormously important look I want to do one more little exercise with you because I think it can be interesting we do a lot of this at school Drive and it can be very helpful you know we're often taught that the primary problem that we have is that we're selfish people right we caused a piece of lamb basses little voice at the back of our heads like you're selfish you're always looking out for yourself etc now this is a hunch but I think it's a very accurate hunch the main problem that most people have is not that they're too selfish most people are not anywhere near to so there are a few outliers who make a lot of noise and we know all about them most of us our problem is another thing we're not selfish enough what I mean by that is we're not very used because we're good boys and girls we're not very used to putting ourselves and our needs and our complaints and our desires centerstage we haven't found that voice to do that and part of the reason sometimes while we're ill and distressed and can't sleep and suffer from anxiety is because we haven't paid enough attention to us we haven't feel being able to feel productively selfish so what I want you to do is again pick a stranger and for a minute or two but no more I want you to complete the following sentence and hear them out as they complete the following sentence with you if I dared to be more selfish I would dot-dot-dot complete that sentence now if I dare to be more selfish I would not go for two minutes okay alright let's come back let's come back together let's come back together thank you so much for that thank you so much thank you so much for that for that exercise and I hope you can continue those conversations outside because after all this is not merely about books this is a festival also of our friendship we've got a little bit of time for some questions so if you've got a question we've got mics as well do put up your hand and share anything ask something we've got some some lovely chance for some questions so go for it yeah anybody on that side that side yes yes hello thank you for you began your talk by describing a scenario where I'm sure very familiar with which is you're at a party and somebody asks you what you do how can I answer that without telling them what I do um well I mean that's a very good question you might tell them what you do but but you might I mean really the sincere bit is I mean there are various replacements and some of them sound corny they may not always be valid etc but I mean really what you want to do is to say something like what are you suffering from what are you where are you alien how how are you sad what are you scared of I mean that's up don't get me wrong there is a real importance for small talk small talk is a very important place you can be talking about the weather and really you're circling your own life the angry sky the intermittent rain these are parts of the internal world not just the external world and so it has its place in in positioning people but quite quickly ultimately what we want is is connection and an encounter with a reality of somebody else's life otherwise you might as well stay home okay yeah I think there's a microphone that might be rushing towards you so hang on this brushing running yeah I can hear me sorry thank you for the lovely talk I was wondering if you could shed some light on what composure is and how one could become more composed well I mean you'll you all guess my answer the way to try and be calm and composed is not to assume an invulnerable stance where somehow it's considered normal to be free of anxiety I think you have to make your peace with how difficult composure will be so I would like to see the ranks of the anxiously composed or the composedly anxious those who know that they would not overcome anxiety fully but have made their peace with that and are not anxious that they are anxious you know so often we beat ourselves up about emotions thinking that they don't belong in us I also think you know if you were to catch me at the train station after this talk you know fighting with my luggage and cursing and being very anxious and ill-tempered you might think all that guy's a real hypocrite he was standing up on stage or telling us he said why sounding things but but that's not what I'm saying I'm saying actually that what we're constantly trying to do is is to live wisely around and with our neurosis rather than trying to escape also you know lovely thing from from Donald Winnicott a lot of parents came to Winnicott very anxious they had small children and they kept saying to him I'm not a good enough parent I'm I'm not you know doing a good job I'm not the parent I wanted to be and he calmed them down with a very useful phrase which has entered common parlance which is no child needs a perfect parent indeed to have a perfect parent is to be on the short road towards psychosis and that the job the job of a parent is to let down a child in a structured way so to gently introduce them to the misery of existence myself my my son Samuel is in the room and he will attest to the fact that I had an overly young age I would say to that I would say to him it's not that I'm a particularly horrible person it's just that you're encountering the horribleness of life via me first but you will later see that this is a general phenomena you just met with it first here and and so broadly speaking what Winnicott was saying is no one needs perfection you just need good enough and and so he came up the phrase they're good enough parent and of course it's not just a good enough parent we need it's good good enough office it's a good enough friend it's the good enough lover it's look enough everything good enough is good enough okay yeah should we not tell our children to be good to be well-behaved how do we deal that apart for your screaming and well six role isn't saying hello to an adult we just ignore that yes that's a very good point and and you know I don't want to you know speak in in in praise of that the noble savage and that and that there should be no rules and boundaries are very important children are very reassured by by a certain degree of opposition to be a child who can do anything that they like is as madness inducing as to be a child who can do nothing that they like because both of those are presenting the child either with an extreme image of its powerlessness or an extreme image of its own nipa Tain's both of which fry the mind so so it's very frightening for a child to not encounter and know one of the best things you can do to a child is disappoint them sometimes firmly and they will be grateful to you eventually by not being mad by not being mad by the fact that you said no but look it's a fine balance I think Winnicott was talking particularly in the very early years and you as I'm sure are a good enough parent you'll sense when actually the child can take it the child can take hearing that they should be little more polite or pull themselves together etc you'll have an instinct and trust that instinct but no of course there is that balance between the true and the false self yeah how should we deal with crushes how should we deal with crushes a crush enjoy it I mean what is a price a crush a crush is a sudden encounter with perfection in another human being you glimpse a face in the library or on the train or the clifden literary festival behind the burger stand and you think there could be nothing wrong with this person there there is a delicacy a kindness and a depth of this person's eyes that just it but tokens of a perfect human being enjoy that but please don't believe it's true there no the secure for love as we know is knowledge get to know them better and part of the problem part of the problem of unrequited love you know the reason why you know you're in love with somebody and you go out in a few days cetera and and and then they say I can never see you again and they run away why is that cruel ultimately that it's cruel because you've denied the person a sense of what you'll really like were you doing the washing-up and when life's got a bit banal etc you've prevented them from seeing aspects of you which would have stopped them being so passionately in love with you so that's a very cruel thing to do so greater knowledge or greater imagination but but let's enjoy why not life is short enjoy the crash I think there was a question there lady with the glasses yes hello and you've mentioned the early caregivers who weren't good enough they weren't able to parent very well and they turned us into good boys and girls maybe they're the parents who let us down in an unstructured way what's the best method of forgiving them when they're dead and you haven't found the right psychotherapists to enable you to make this wrong well well okay that's a very good question I would hazard a guess I would hazard a guess that you're not so much interested in forgiveness and more interested in overcoming the legacy that they've given you so the grille question here I mean part forgiveness I think you forgive this comes naturally once yeah right so when you once you've made peace forgiveness will come so the break which is how do you make peace and I think it is getting a very secure handle on what it is that went wrong now for some of the things some of the it's a very strange thing about our minds we hear the word trauma a lot many of us are walking around with mini traumas in certain areas and by trauma I mean something that cannot be thought of or something that cannot be thought of very easily so it may take a long long time until you're deep into middle-age before you can for the first time see something and and feel it for yourself you may have known you know dad was a bit angry or mum was a little sad or made me feel guilty etcetera but really to re-experience that um that's the work can be the work of decades I think that psychotherapy look I'm going to show by psychotherapy is one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century there are many bad therapists out there there are undoubtedly and many of us have had bad psychotherapy but I think the notion of a skilled human being who will listen and interpret your story and play you back to you and see things that because you're traumatize you may be extremely clever um you can't see this is extremely vital that's all you say what about a friend kind of threatened of course a friend cut it just like a friend can't fly the plane you need a trained pilot you know you need a certain degree of training to listen and replay etc so I do very much believe in psychotherapy okay one last question I think we have time for yeah sorry by the way if you want to know more little advertise I'm sorry clippin festival you're so great if I can advertise something we're doing the School of Life next weekend if you want to fly to New York you can hear me whurling on for three and a half days about all of this in a giant and not giant actually quite intimate conference space but it's a it's a giant attempt to take somebody on a journey so lookup school of life calm and then look up New York conference and you can have more of this if you want forgive the advertising pitch back to your question sorry just talking about your your journey yes the replacement of religion why is it not the school of life and death because that's really the big mystery in that explain that's what religion helps us with why you're not the school of life and death school of and death we are we are implicitly you're absolutely right of course a negotiation with death is I mean look you know think of Montagnes famous quote to philosophize is to learn to die our acceptance of our mortality is so central for the buddhists the goal is to die before you die in other words to relinquish certain sorts of unhelpful attachment before death actually comes so it's in everything that we do it's in every it's behind forgiveness you forgive when you realize you're mortal and the other is mortal it's behind compassion knowing that you are we are dealing constantly with other mortal beings if we thought that everybody was immortal my goodness we could afford to be cruel and we could afford to be tough but we're not we've got a very limited run this planet and on that basis we need urgently to forgive ourselves to understand ourselves to feel compassion for ourselves and to extend some of that luxury towards others on that note we have to bring it to an end please come and get a book signed if you like it's been such a pleasure thank you so much different [Music]"

    "Title": "Why We Should Dare to Be More Selfish",
    "Transcript": "From a young age, we are taught that one of the greatest risks to our integrity and flourishing is our own selfishness. We must - wherever possible - learn to think more of other people, keep in mind how often we fail to see things from their point of view, and be aware of the small and large ways in which we disadvantage and ignore collective interests. Being good means, at its most basic, putting other people more squarely at the center of our lives. But for some of us, the problem isn't so much that we are heedless to this advice, rather that we take it far too closely and remorselessly to heart. So mindful are we of the risks of selfishness, we run into an opposite danger: an abnegation of the self, a modesty that borders on self-erasure, an automatic impulse to give everything over to competing parties, a shyness about pressing oneself forward and a manic inability to say 'no' or cause the slightest frustration to others. And so, as a result of our talents at 'selflessness', we fill our diaries with obligations to people who bore and drain us, we stick at jobs that neglect our true talents and we stay for far too long in relationships with people who deceive us, annoy us and subtly (and possibly with a lot of sentimental sweetness) take us for a very long ride. And then one morning we wake up and find that the bulk of our life is already behind us, that our best years are spent and that no one is especially grateful for our sacrifices, that there isn't a reward in heaven for our renunciations and that we are furious with ourselves for mistaking meekness and self-surrender for kindness. The priority may then be to rediscover our latent reserves of selfishness. The very word may be frightening, because we aren't taught to distinguish - as we must - between bad and good versions of this trait; between, on the one hand, the kind of selfishness that viciously exploits and reduces others, that operates with no higher end in view, that disregards people out of meanness and negligence, and on the other, the kind of selfishness that we require to get anything substantial done, that lends us the courage to prioritise our own concerns over the flotsam and jetsam of daily life, that lends us the spirit to be more forthright about our interests with people who claim to love us - and that at moments leads us to sidestep nagging demands not in order to make people suffer, but so that we can husband our resources and in time, be able to serve the world in the best way we can. With a more fruitfully selfish philosophy in mind, we might fight to have an hour to ourselves each day. We may do something that could get us labelled as 'self-indulgent' (having psychotherapy three times a week or writing a book), but that is vital to our spirit. We might go on a trip on our own, because so much has happened that we need to process in silence. We cannot be good to anyone else until we have serviced some of our own inner callings. A lack of selfishness may be the fastest route to turning us into ineffective, embittered and ultimately highly disagreeable people. Hindu philosophy can be a useful guide here, for it divides up our lives into four stages, each with its distinctive roles and responsibilities. The first is that of the bachelor student (known as Brahmacharya), the second that of the householder and parent (Grihastha) and the third that of the grandparent and semi-retired advisor (Vanaprastha). But it's the fourth that is the really interesting age in this context: known as Sannyasa, this is the time when - after years of service to other people, to business, family and society - we finally throw off our worldly obligations and focus instead on the development of our psychological and spiritual sides. We might sell up our house, go travelling and wander the world to learn, talk to strangers, open our eyes and nourish our minds. In the period of sannyasa, we live simply (perhaps by a beach or by the side of a mountain); we eat basic food and have few belongings, we cut our ties with everyone who has nothing spirit-related to tell us, anyone who is on the make and in too much of a hurry, anyone who doesn't spend a substantial amount of their time reflecting on the meaning of being alive. What feels insightful about this division of existence is that it acknowledges that a Sannyasa way of living can't be right for everyone at anytime - yet on the same score, that no good life can be complete without a version of it. There are years when we simply have to keep our heads down and study, years when we have to bring up children, and accumulate some capital. But there are also, just as importantly, years when what we need to do above all is say 'enough', enough to material and superficial demands, enough to sexual and romantic entanglements, enough to status and sociability - and instead, learn to turn our minds inwards and upwards. Without having to don the orange robe favoured by Hindu Sannyasas, with perhaps few visible signs of our reorientation to speak of, it is open to all of us to make a psychological move into a more self-focused and inner age. We can convey to those around us that we aren't lazy, mad, or callous; we just need to avoid doing the expected things for a while now. We need to fulfill our real promise by casting aside an idea that is only ever superficially wise: always putting other people first. Our perspective cards feature tools for a wiser calmer perspective on life, they help to restore calm and clarity even during difficult times."

    "Title": "The Charms of Unavailable People",
    "Transcript": "It's an odd feature of love that some of our most romantic moments include these scenarios: – being with a lover who lives a whole continent away from us and can never move to be closer. - an infatuation with a lover who is married to someone else and has no will to leave them. – a romance with someone dying of a disease that will kill them within a matter of months. – a crush on someone at the library – who we never talk to yet think of obsessively (even when it turns out they have a partner). – the last days of a holiday romance before we have to take a gruelling 12 hour flight back home. What unites all these situations is an external obstacle to love which, paradoxically, serves to make our desire more intense. We might suppose that our love would be strong in spite of the challenges – but the situation is weirder than this: our love is strong precisely because a proper relationship is not possible in the real world, because love is fated to be in some way unrequited or incomplete. People stuck in these unrequited situations may garner a lot of sympathy and seem like the natural friends of true love. But they tend to be no such things. They are timid visitors to the land of love, who have carefully chosen situations which will prevent them from ever taking up more permanent residence. They are self-saboteurs, who would rather be in control of a sad situation than half out of control of a happy one. They have carefully made sure that there is no chance to disappoint or be disappointed. It is the external obstacle that gives them the security to surrender themselves totally to feelings that they would keep well at bay if – miraculously – the obstacle were to be removed. To feel a lot for someone who is available is an emotionally highly flammable requirement. The possibilities for getting hurt are enormous. We might learn to trust a lover over years, and then promptly find that they had decided to leave us, or died in the night. We couldn't survive; our defences mask too gelatinous an interior. We would have given them the keys to our self-confidence and direction – and would struggle (after so long) to know how to carry on. Not all of us have the psychological histories that make us robust enough to dare enter situations where mutual trust is a risk we can endure day-to-day. We may have been too badly let down as children (perhaps a parent left us or humiliated us), and are at some level therefore profoundly determined never again to surrender in the true sense to another person (we may of course be married and yet still feeling this way – if we've taken care to marry a non-responsive, distracted partner). We don't put it that way to ourselves of course. We are most likely not even aware of the pattern we're involved in; we just feel very in love with someone who happens to reside far away and report that the person who has an apartment round the corner is truly very boring and not that sexy. It sounds – for a time, before you can see the pattern – quite plausible. The true challenge of relationships is not to fall in love with someone who may never want to see us again: it is to accept the far more interesting, and truly heroic challenge, of falling in love with someone who isn't dying, stationed in the Arctic or married to someone else – and would have no objection to seeing us all the time. Impossible situations feel so romantic not because we have found a soulmate, but because the absence of risk has loosened our hearts. We should – with time – learn to dare to turn our amorous attentions to that deeply dangerous threatening character: the person we know, who likes us a lot and who is available all the time. That would be truly romantic. To learn more about love try our book on, \"How To Find Love\", which explains why we have the types we do."

    "Title": "How To Simplify Your Life",
    "Transcript": "It is well understood by good parents that life should only ever get so exciting for a baby: after friends have come around and brought presents and made animated faces, after there has been some cake and some cuddles, after there have been a lot of bright lights and perhaps some songs too, enough is enough. The baby will start to look stern and then burst into tears and the wise parent knows that nothing is particularly wrong (though the baby may by now be wailing): it is just time for a nap. The brain needs to process, digest and divide up the welter of experiences that have been ingested, and so the curtains are drawn, baby is laid down next to the soft toys and soon it is asleep and calm descends. Everyone knows that life is going to be a lot more manageable again in an hour. Sadly, we exercise no such caution with ourselves. We schedule a week in which we will see friends every night, in which we'll do 12 meetings (three of them requiring a lot of preparation), where we'll make a quick overnight dash to another country on the Wednesday, where we'll watch three films, read 14 newspapers, change six pairs of sheets, have five heavily meals after 8pm and drink 30 coffees - and then we lament that our lives are not as calm as they might be and that we are close to mental collapse. We refuse to take seriously how much of our babyhood is left inside our adult selves - and therefore, how much care we have to take to keep things simple and very very calm. What registers as anxiety is typically no freakish phenomenon; it is the mind's logical enraged plea not to be continuously and exhaustingly overstimulated. What are some of the things we may need to do to simplify our lives: Fewer People; fewer commitments It is theoretically a privilege to have a lot of people to see and things to do. It is also - psychologically-speaking - exhausting and ultimately rather dangerous. The manner of expression is a little dated and brutal, and one might want to quibble over the exact timings, but this point from Nietzsche remains acute: “Today as always, men fall into two groups: slaves and free men. Whoever does not have two-thirds of his day for himself, is a slave, whatever he may be: a statesman, a businessman, an official, or a scholar.” We need to recognise that what is physically possible for us to achieve in a day is not, for that matter, psychologically wise or plausible. It may well be feasible to nip over to a foreign capital or two in a day and run a company alongside managing a household but nor should we be surprised if such routines ultimately contribute to a breakdown. Sleep Plenty of it of course; at least seven hours. Or if we can't manage it, we need at a minimum fully to recognise how much we are deprived, so that we won't aggravate our sorrows by searching for abstruse explanations for them. We don't necessarily have to get divorced, retrain in a completely different profession or move country: we just need to get some more rest. Media What we're taking in when we check our phones is perhaps the single greatest contributor to our mental ill-health. For most of history, it was inconceivable that there could ever be such a thing as 'too much news'. Information from political circles or foreign countries was rare, prized and expensive (it was as unlikely that one could gorge oneself on it as one could on chocolate bars). But since the middle of the twentieth century, news has been commodified and, in the process, it has become a major - though still too little known - risk to our mental survival. Every minute of every day presents us with untold options for filling our minds with the mania, exploits, disasters, furies, reversals, ambitions, triumphs, insanity and cataclysms of strangers around our benighted planet. Always, news organisations speak of our need to know - and to need to know right now. But what they have left out is our equally great, and often even greater need not to know: because we cannot change anything, because the stories are too violent, dispiriting and sad, because our minds are fragile, because we have responsibilities closer to home, because we need to lead our own lives rather than be torn apart by stories of the lives of others who are ultimately as remote from and irrelevant to us as the inhabitants of the Egyptian court of King Sneferu in late 2,613 BC. Thinking Insomnia and anxiety are the mind's revenge for all the thoughts we refuse to have consciously in the day. In order to be able to find rest, we need to carve off chunks of time where we have nothing to do other than lie in bed with a pad and paper in order to think. We need to consider three topics in particular: - What is making me anxious? - Who has caused me pain and how? - What is exciting me? We need to sift through the chaotic contents of our minds. Every hour of living requires at least ten minutes of sifting. Expectations Of course, it might be pleasant to be extraordinary, famous and world-beating, but maybe it will be an even greater achievement to stay sane and kind. We might opt not to conquer the world in favour of living a longer, and more serene life. We are not backing away from a challenge, we're simply shifting our sense of what the real challenge might be - and more importantly where the real rewards may lie. A quiet life isn't necessarily one of resignation or flight, it may constitute a supremely wise recognition that the truly satisfying things are available away from the spotlight and the big cities, on modest salaries and as far as possible from the manic, sleepless competition to 'win' the professional status race. As we're discovering, excitement is fun for a time; but it also kills. Simplicity is true wisdom; we need more naps. Do you need a detox from your devices? Our phone detox is designed to help give you a well-deserved break from your phone."

    "Title": "You Should Finally Leave School",
    "Transcript": "Technically, most of us leave school at 18 - an event that tends to be vividly etched in memory and surrounded by considerable ceremony and emotion. And yet, rather oddly, despite appearances, many of us in fact don't manage to leave school at that point at all. In a deep part of our minds, we may still be there, deep into adulthood, not sitting in a classroom precisely, but in terms of how our minds work, as much stuck within the confines of a school-based world-view as if we were showing up for assembly every day - generating immense and unnecessary degrees of unhappiness and compromise for ourselves in the process. What might be some of the hallmarks of an enduring school-like way of thinking: 1. - First and foremost, a firm belief that those in authority know what they are doing and that one's task is to obey and jump through the hoops they set for us. A desire to please teachers and gain prizes, cups and ribbons. 2 - A sense that there is an implicit curriculum out there - an externally mandated map of what one needs to do to succeed - and that a wise person must dutifully subscribe to its demands. 3 - A feeling that work should - when it's going well - feel substantially irksome, dull and somewhat pointless. Schools teach us to forget, or ignore, the clues offered to us by our own boredom. They teach us dangerous degrees of patience. They subtly train us in intellectual masochism. 4 - You're doing it for someone else; an audience. Your teachers and your parents, and their substitutes in adult life. Make us proud. You have to shine. We've given you so much. What matters is the performance, not any inner sense of satisfaction. 5. - Authority is benign. They want what is good for you and they speak on behalf of your long-term interests. Don't think you could ever know better; distrust your instincts. We'll look after you. If you follow our rules, you will thrive. 6 - The exam (and all its successors) are fundamentally accurate. They, those who know, have worked out the ultimate test of your value. You are what you score. 7 - Every school is in addition a miniature society - equipped with a strong sense of what values to revere and codes to follow. Bullies lurk, ready to mock and identify any departures from the norm. You can't escape them; they are next to you in class every day. They will spot and persecute the weirdos; they can ruin your life. You learn to cower and adjust your attitudes. Following the herd is paramount. All these ways of thinking don't require us to be sitting in a geography class. We might be in an office selling garden furniture to the Belgian market and thinking like this; we might have children of our own and by all appearances be an adult, and yet still be living inside as though there were 'exams' to pass and cups to be won. What would it mean to break the mold? What would it mean finally to leave school? To know some of the following: 1. - That there is no one way, no guarantee of one set path to fulfilment laid out by authority figures. 'They' don't know. No one knows. 2. - The safe path may be entirely dangerous to our flourishing. 3. - Our boredom is a vital tool. It is telling us what is slowly killing us - and reminding us that time is monstrously short. 4. - Authority is not by definition benign. The teachers and their substitutes have no real plan for you - except in so far as it suits their own advancement. It looks like they want your supreme good but in reality they want you to play their game for their own benefit. At the end, they have no proper prize to offer you. They'll give you a colourful card and send you to the golf course and the grave and have wasted your life. 5. - It doesn't matter what the bullies think. No one is normal. You can dare to make enemies; indeed you must do so as the price to pay for having developed a character and found something truly to believe in. We shouldn't be tough on ourselves for lingering so long. School is an immensely impressive system. We start there when we are not much bigger than a chair. For more than a decade, it's all we know, it is the outside world - and is what those who love us most tell us we should respect. It speaks with immense authority not just about itself, but about life in general. It is sold to us as a preparation for the whole of existence. But of course, the main thing it does is to prepare us for yet more school; it is an education in how to thrive within its own profoundly peculiar rules - with only a tenuous connection to the world beyond. Knowing all this, we might do a very strange-sounding thing, finally work up the courage to leave our inner school, be it at 28, 35 or 62 - and enter the wider boundless world we have been in flight from for too long. At The School Of Life we believe that confidence is a skill we can all learn. Our confidence prompt cards are designed to help us master this essential skill. Click now to learn more."

    "Title": "There Is Always a Plan B",
    "Transcript": "We grow up - inevitably - with a strong attachment to a plan A, that is, an idea of how our lives will go and what we need to do to achieve our particular set of well-defined goals. For example, we'll do four years of law school, then move out west, buy a house and start a family. Or, we'll go to medical school for 7 years, then go to another country and train in our speciality of interest and hope to retire by fifty. Or we'll get married and raise two children with an emphasis on the outdoors and doing good in the world. But then, for some of us and at one level all of us, life turns out to have made a few other plans. A sudden injury puts a certain career forever out of reach. A horrible and unexpected bit of office politics blackens our name and forces us out of our professional path. We discover an infidelity or make a small but significant error which changes everything about how crucial others view us. And so, promptly, we find we have to give up on plan A altogether. The realisation can feel devastating. Sobbing or terrified, we wonder how things could have turned out this way. By what piece of damnation has everything come to this? Who could have predicted that the lively and hopeful little boy or girl we once were would have to end up in such a forlorn and pitiful situation? We alternately weep and rage at the turn of events. It is for such moments that we should, even when things appear calm and hopeful, consider one of life's most vital skills: that of developing a plan B. The first element involves fully acknowledging that we are never cursed for having to make a plan B. Plan As simply do not work out all the time. No one gets through life with all their careful plan As intact. Something unexpected, shocking and abhorrent regularly comes along, not only to us, but to all human beings. We are simply too exposed to accident, too lacking in information, too frail in our capacities, to avoid some serious avalanches and traps. The second point is to realise that we are, despite moments of confusion, eminently capable of developing very decent plan Bs. The reason why we often don't trust that we can is that children can't so easily - and childhood is where we have all came from and continue to be influenced by in ways it's hard to recognise. When children's plans go wrong, they can't do much in response: they have to stay at the same school, they can't divorce their parents, they can't move to another country or shift job. They're locked in and immobile. But adults are not at all this way, a glorious fact which we keep needing to refresh in our minds and draw comfort from in anxious moments. We have enormous capacities to act and to adapt. The path ahead may be blocked, but we have notable scope to find other routes through. One door may close, but there truly are many other entrances to try. We do not have only one way through this life, even if - at times - we cling very fervently to a picture of how everything should and must be. We're a profoundly adaptable species. Perhaps we'll have to leave town forever, maybe we'll have to renounce an occupation we spent a decade nurturing, perhaps it will be impossible to remain with someone in who It can feel desperate - until we rediscover our latent plan B muscle. In reality, there would be a possibility to relocate, to start afresh in another domain, to find someone else, to navigate around the disastrous event. There was no one script for us written at our birth, and nor does there need to be only one going forward. It helps, in flexing our plan B muscles, to acquaint ourselves with the lives of many others who had to throw away plan As and begin anew: the person who thought they'd be married forever, then suddenly weren't - and coped; the person who was renowned for doing what they did, then had to start over in a dramatically different field - and found a way. Amidst these stories, we're liable to find a few people who will tell us, very sincerely, that their plan B ended up, eventually, superior to their plan A. They worked harder for it, they had to dig deeper to find it and it carried less vanity and fear within it. Crucially, we don't need to know right now what our plan Bs might be. We should simply feel confident that we will, if and when we need to, be able to work them out. We don't need to ruminate on them all now or anticipate every frustration that might come our way; we should simply feel confident that, were the universe to command it, we would know how to find a very different path. Our Decision Dice are a tool to help you make wiser decisions in work, love and the rest of your life."

    "Title": "How To Cope With Depression",
    "Transcript": "Almost half of us will suffer from depression at some point in our lives, but the condition remains badly misunderstood and therefore often poorly treated. At the heart of our collective difficulty with depression is a confusion about what it actually is - and in particular, how it can be distinguished from a state all of us know very well and with which it is has a distracting number of similarities, namely sadness. It's because we unwittingly tend to apply to cases of depression a number of assumptions drawn from, and better suited to, an understanding of sadness that we end up suffering far more than we should. There are, on the surface, some notable similarities between those who are sad and those who are depressed. Both groups cry; both withdraw from the world; both complain of listlessness and a sense of alienation from their normal lives. But there is one categorical difference between depression and sadness. The sad person knows what they are sad about; the depressed person doesn't. Sad people can, without difficulty, tell us what is troubling them. I am sad that my grandmother has died. Or that I lost my job. Or that my friends are being unkind to me. And - though it might sound strange - this is precisely what the depressed person is not capable of doing. They may be tearful and at a very low ebb, but they can't conclusively put a finger on what has drained life of meaning for them: they simply say it has no meaning per se. They aren't depressed about x or y as one might be sad about x or y. They are, first and foremost simply depressed. The inability of the depressed person to account concretely for their mood can lay them open to unwarranted charges of faking, malingering or exaggerating. Friends who begin in a well-meaning search for a soluble problem can end up frustrated by the lack of progress. When pushed, the depressed person may latch on to rather odd or minor-sounding issues to account for their state: they might complain that there is no point going to work because the earth is due to be absorbed by the sun in 7.5 billion years. Or they might insist that life lacks all meaning because they've just dropped a glass on the floor and everything is now completely hopeless. At this stage, one can hear it said that if depression doesn't have any any sensible psychological causes, the problem must be bound up with some kind of imbalance in brain chemistry, which it would be kinder and more effective to treat with pills - an idea of great appeal to the pharmaceutical industry first and foremost, but also to worried families and schools and employers who crave rapid and cost-effective solutions. But there is another approach to depression which, though slower and more arduous, may be a great deal more effective in the long-term. This stems from insights drawn from psychotherapy, the discipline that has - arguably - been able to understand depression better than any other. The basic premise of psychotherapy is that the depressed person isn't depressed - as they suggest - for no reason. There is a reason. They are very distressed about something but that something is proving extremely difficult to take on board, and has therefore been pushed into the outer zones of consciousness - from where it wreaks havoc on the whole person, prompting boundless feelings of nihilism. For depressives, realising what they are concretely upset about would be too devastating, so they unconsciously choose to remain dead to everything, as opposed to very distraught about something. Depression is sadness that has forgotten its true causes - forgotten because remembering may generate overwhelming, untenable feelings of pain and loss. What might these true causes be? Perhaps that we have married the very wrong person. Or that our sexuality isn't what we once believed. Or that we are furious with a parent for their lack of care in childhood. In order to preserve a fragile peace of mind, one then 'chooses' - though that may sound more willed than it is in reality - to be depressed rather than to have a realisation. We pick unceasing numbness as protection against dreadful insight. To make things yet more difficult, the depressed person doesn't typically consciously feel that they are in fact lacking insight. They are not aware of a gap in their self-understanding. Furthermore, they are nowadays often taught to assume that they are 'just depressed', as one might be physically ill - a verdict that can be of appeal as much to the pharmaceutical industry as to certain people close to the patient with an interest in insights remaining buried. There's another key difference to note between sadness and depression. Sad people are grief-stricken about something out in the world but they aren't necessarily sad about themselves, their self-esteem is unaffected by their grief, whereas depressed people will characteristically feel wretched about themselves and be full of self-recrimination, guilt, shame and self-loathing paranoia that may, at tragic extremes, culminate in suicidal thoughts. For psychotherapy, the origins of these violent moods of self-hatred lie in anger due for, but unable to be directed towards, someone else in the world - that has then turned against the sufferer. Wrathful feelings that should have gone outwards, towards a partner who is relentlessly defensive and denies one sex or a parent who humiliated one in childhood, are instead driven back onto the sufferer and starts to attack them. The feeling: 'X has horribly let me down' turns into a very unpleasant but in some ways more bearable 'I'm an unworthy and unbearable wretch.' One becomes self-hating as a defence against the risks of hating someone else. Also worth noting in all this is that, in many cases, depression is associated with an apparently opposite mood, a kind euphoric state termed mania, hence the term 'manic-depressive'. The mania in question looks, from a distance, a bit like happiness, just like depression can look like sadness. But in one area in particular, the relationship between mania and happiness is identical to that between depression and sadness. The common element is a disavowed self-knowledge. In mania, one is euphoric, but cannot go into one's own deep mind and discover its bitter truths. Which explains one of the leading characteristics of manic people: their habit of being in flight from themselves, talking too fast about nothing, over-exercising, working continuously or spending too much - all as an escape from a submerged grief, rage and loss. It is from this kind of diagnosis that a suggested cure emerges. What people in depression need above all is a chance to arrive at insight. For this, they will tend to need a hugely supportive and patient listener. They may also - used appropriately - benefit from temporary use of medication to lift their mood just enough so that they can endure a conversation. But the assumption isn't that brain chemistry is where the problem either begins or ends; the despair is caused by an undigested, unknown and unresolved trauma. Far from needing to be taken through reasons to trust that life is beautiful, depressives must be allowed to feel and to remember specific damage - and to be granted a fundamental sense of the legitimacy of their emotions. They need to be allowed to be angry, and for the anger to settle on the right, awkward targets. The goal in treating depression is to move a sufferer from feeling limitlessly despairing to mourning the loss of something in particular: the last twenty years, a marriage, a hope one would be loved by one's father, a career... However agonising the insight and mourning might be, these must always be preferable to allowing loss to contaminate the totality of one's perspective. There are plenty of dreadful things in every life - which is why it is wholly normal to feel sad on a regular basis. But there are also always a sufficient number of things that remain beautiful and hopeful, so long as one has been allowed to understand and known one's pain and anger - and adequately mourn one's losses.

    "Title": "The Fear of Happiness",
    "Transcript": "Given how much we all long to be happy, we might presume that accepting the possibility of happiness in our lives would be an uncomplicated, serene and automatic process. But for many of us, however theoretically attached we might be to the notion of being happy, the possibility of actually being so is liable to trigger deep ambivalence and fear. We would – it appears – often prefer to be worried and sad rather than attempt take on the risks surreptitiously connected in our minds with positive moods. We may – however paradoxical it sounds – be nothing less than afraid to be happy. As ever, our fear has a history that begins in childhood, where one of the following is likely to have occurred. Someone we deeply loved, and perhaps admired too, was unhappy. Their sorrow moved us profoundly and led us to identify with them so that our caution around contentment continues to function as a secret tribute to them. To be happy would, in a way that would pain us profoundly, mean being disloyal. However much they might on the surface have encouraged us to venture out and seize opportunities for joy, an important part of us wishes to stay with them under the canopy of grief. So without knowing we're doing this, we ensure that we will always have a modest career because they never had educational possibilities or we turn down sexual opportunities because they were sexually neglected. Alternatively, someone we were close to might have been jealous of us and led us to want to downplay our achievements and hide our contentment – in order to feel safe from their envy and rage. We learnt to associate gloom with safety and joy with risk. More generally, we may have lacked any plausible role models for happiness. We may have grown up in an environment where being anxious and panicky was the default state, where it seemed natural to picture the plane crashing, the police showing up, the business collapsing and the mole morphing into cancer. We may be intellectually aware that there could be other ways to interpret the future, but equanimity doesn't feel like what our tribe does. To this resistance, we might have added a layer of intellectual superiority: happiness seems for the little people, the leading symptom of understanding the world intelligently must be sadness. All such positions contribute to a psyche where the onset of happiness is a cause for grave and glaring alarm. When we are finally on holiday, or in love or surrounded by friends or free of financial pressure, we panic. Our senses have been jammed for so long in fear mode, they are filled with dread when the alarm stops wailing. To return to a more balanced state, we're liable systematically to sabotage the conditions of contentment. We start working on holiday and soon uncover a cause for concern at the office; within hours, we may be protesting that we need to return home. Or else we do our utmost to convince a new lover that we're not worth it, by seldom calling them or (if they really don't get the message) having an affair. It feels so much more normal to be abandoned. In order to acclimatise ourselves to joy, we need to return to the past and unpick how we learnt to use anxiety as a defensive strategy to protect us against other threats we were too young and too easily overwhelmed to answer. The manic worrier worries, as it were, about 'everything' because they are unable to be appropriately concerned with, and in mourning for, one or two big things from long ago. The anxiety that belonged to one particular distant time and place has been redistributed and subdivided across hundreds of ever shifting topics in the present (from workplace to reputation, money to household tasks), because its true source and origins remain unknown to the sufferer. We are using the flotsam and jetsam of everyday worries as a proxy for an unmasterable trauma: shame; humiliation; a sense we don't matter to our caregivers; neglect or abuse. We should not sarcastically point out to worriers that they need 'something else to worry about', we should realise that something terrifying that they have buried deep in their unconscious is lending a continuous sense of dread to their fragile present. We manic worriers need not sarcasm but supportive and intelligent company to give us the love we need to dare to look back at the past – and the insight with which to try to do so. Our dread is a symptom of an ancient sorrow, a sign that we keep not finding anything in the outer world that answers to the horror of the inner one. Needless to say, it isn't the case that there is never anything to worry about in the present, just that there is a lot less than the manic worrier tends to believe. Furthermore, what there is to worry about can be coped with with far more resilience than the manic worrier can imagine, for they are operating with what is essentially a child's sense of their own powers and capacity for survival. Manic worriers should gradually come to exchange their feelings of dread for the future for a patient understanding and mourning for an unfairly traumatic and as yet insufficiently explored past. There is nothing greedy or stupid about happiness. The ability to take appropriate satisfaction from the good times is a profound psychological achievement: it is a mark of deep seriousness to be able to giggle, have a pillow fight with a child, delight in a fig, sunbathe, sometimes knock off work early to have an ice cream and appreciate a daffodil. Sorrow is obvious; there is always a richness of reasons to despair. Fear is safe as well; if we are waiting for the enemy with sword in hand, we may gain a vital few seconds were the blow to come. But the trulycourageous and heroically defiant move would be to dare to put down our weapon, lessen our preparations for catastrophe, resist the terrors ingrained in us over decades and once in a while believe that, astonishingly, for a time, there might truly be nothing to worry about.

    "Title": "How To Know Yourself",
    "Transcript": "Many of us are wandering the earth, accomplished in many ways, capable of fulfillment at points, but with a fundamental wound that stops us from becoming who we might be: we don't quite know who we are.It isn't, of course, that we can't remember the basics of our biographies. We're unsure around two things in particular: we don't have a stable sense of what we are worth, and we don't have a secure hold on our own values or judgements. Without knowing who we are, we tend to have particular trouble coping with either denigration or adulation. If others decide that we are worthless or bad, there will be nothing inside us to prevent us from swallowing their verdicts in their entirety, however wrong-headed, extreme or unkind they may be. We will be helpless before the court of public opinion. We'll always be asking others what we deserve before seeking inside for an answer. Lacking an independent verdict, we also stand to be unnaturally hungry for external praise: the clapping of an audience will matter more than would ever be wise. We'll be prey to rushing towards whatever idea or activity the crowd happen to love. We will laugh at jokes that aren't funny, uncritically accept undeserving concepts that are in vogue and neglect our truer talents for easy popular wins. We'll trail public opinion slavishly, constantly checking the world's whims rather than consulting an inner barometer in order to know what we should want, feel and value.We need to be kind on ourselves. No one is born with an independent ability to know who they are. We learn to have an identity because, if we are blessed, in our early years, someone else takes the trouble to study us with immense fairness, attention and kindness and then plays us back to us in a way that makes sense and that we can later emulate. They give us the beginning of a true portrait of our identity which we take on and enrich over the years and use as a defence against the distorting verdicts from hurried or ill-intentioned others. Knowing who one is is really the legacy of having been known properly by someone else at the start.This early identity-building tends to unfold with apparently innocuous life-saving small steps. 'It must really have hurt,' a parent might say in response to an upset, thereby validating an infant's own feelings. Or: 'it's OK not to feel happy on your birthday,' the parent might say another point, delicately upholding an infant's less typical response to certain events. Ideally, the child isn't just known, he or she is also interpreted as likeable. A good parent offers generous interpretations; they are on the side of the child and are always ready to put the best possible gloss on moments of ill-temper or of failure – which forms the basis upon which resilient self-esteem can then later emerge. That is the ideal, but it can of course go very wrong – and often does. A parent may offer mirroring that is out of synch with the reality of the child. 'Look who is such a happy little boy/girl,' a parent might insist when the opposite is the case, badly scrambling the child's ability to connect with their own emotions. Or the parent might only lend the child a very punitive way of interpreting itself, repeatedly suggesting that it is ill-intentioned and no good. Or the parent may simply not show very much interest in the child, focusing themselves elsewhere, so that the child grows up with a sense that not only is it not worth cherishing, but also – because it has not been adequately seen and mirrored – that it doesn't quite exist. A feeling of unreality is the direct consequence of emotional neglect. Realising that we lack a stable identity is a sobering realisation. But we can, with a fair wind, start to correct the problem at any point. We need to seek out the help of a wise and kindly other person, perhaps a good psychotherapist, who can study us closely, mirror us properly and then validate what they see. Through their eyes, we can learn to study, perhaps for the first time, how we really feel and take seriously what we actually want. We can, by being witnessed generously, more often take our own sides and feel increasingly solid inside, trusting ourselves more than the crowd, feeling that we might be able to say no, not always swaying in the wind and feeling that we are in possession of some of the ultimate truths about us. Having come to know ourselves like this, we will be a little less hungry for praise, a little less worried by opposition – and much more original in our thinking. We will have learnt the vital art of both knowing and befriending who we really are. Our Know Yourself Cards help us to better understand the deepest most elusive aspects of ourselves.

    "Title": "How to Overcome Trauma",
    "Transcript": "Psychological trauma can be defined as a negative event so overwhelming that we cannot properly understand, process or move on from it – but, and this is the devilish aspect to it, nor can we properly remember it or reflect upon its nature and its effects on us. It is lodged within us but remains hidden from us, making its presence known only via symptoms and pains, altering our sense of reality without alerting us to its devilish subterranean operations. Unsurprisingly, a lot of psychological trauma happens in childhood. Children are especially vulnerable to being traumatised, because they are congenitally unable to understand themselves or the world very well – and have to rely to an uncommon degree on parents who are frequently less than mature, patient or balanced. A child may, for example, be traumatised by a parent who – through no particular fault of their own – becomes heavily depressed shortly after childbirth. Or a child may be traumatised through exposure to a parent's titanic rage or violence. Or, because the widest category of psychological trauma is also the most innocuous, a child may be traumatised by what psychologists term 'neglect', which might mean that, at a critical age (between 0 and 5, and especially in the first 18 months), it was not properly cherished, soothed, comforted and, to use a large but valuable word, loved. Image result for bridget riley The leading symptom of having been traumatised is fear. Traumatised people are, above anything else, scared. They are scared of getting close to others, of being abandoned, of being humiliated and disgraced, of falling ill, probably of sex, of travelling, of their bodies, of parties, of key bits of their mind and – in the broad sense – of the world. The legacy of having been traumatised is dread, an un nameable, forgotten, unconscious memory of terror and fear projected outwards into a future. As the psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott observed: 'The catastrophe the traumatised fear will happen has already happened'. That is why, in order to find out the gist of what might have occurred to us long ago, we should ask ourselves not so much about the past (we won't directly be able to remember), but about what are we afraid will happen to us going forward. Our apprehension holds the best clues as to our history. Crucially, and surprisingly, it can take a very long while before traumatised people even realise they are such a thing. A leading consequence of trauma is to have no active memory of what was traumatic – and therefore no sense of how distorted one's picture of reality actually now is. Traumatised people don't go around thinking that they are unnaturally scared: they just think that everything is terrifying. They don't notice their appallingly low sense of self-worth: they just assume that others are likely to mock and dislike them. They don't realise how uncomfortable intimacy is: they merely report not being happy in this or that relationship. In other words, trauma colours our view of reality but at the same time, prevents us from noticing the extent to which we are peering at life through a highly distorted lense. Only with a lot of time, luck, self-reflection and perhaps the odd breakdown do traumatised people come to a position where they start to notice that the way they think of the world isn't necessarily the way it actually is. It is a vast step towards mental well-being to be able to be usefully suspicious of one's first impulses and to begin to observe how much suspicion, fear and self-hatred one is bringing to situations that truly don't warrant them. Working through trauma usually works best when we can hook up our own malfunctioning and distorted brain to another more clear-sighted one – and can test our readings of reality against those of a wise friend or therapist. We stand to recognise that – to our great surprise – we are not perhaps inherently disgusting; maybe not everyone hates us; perhaps everything isn't headed for complete disaster; maybe we are not in line for a horrific punishment. And crucially, if we do suffer reversals, maybe we could find our way out of them, because we are (and this can come as a true revelation) now adults, not the nine month old infant whose trauma altered our mind. Overcoming trauma is the work of years – but the beginning of the end starts with a very small step: coming to realise that we might actually be traumatised and that the world may not be the dark, fearful, overwhelming and dread-filled place we had always assumed it had to be.

    "Title": "20 Signs You're Emotionally Mature",
    "Transcript": "20 Signs you are Emotionally Mature 1. You realise that most of the bad behaviour of other people really comes down to fear and anxiety - rather than, as it is generally easier to presume, nastiness or idiocy. You loosen your hold on self-righteousness and stop thinking of the world as populated by either monsters or fools. It makes things less black and white at first, but in time, a great deal more interesting. 2. You learn that what is in your head can't automatically be understood by other people. You realise that, unfortunately, you will have to articulate your intentions and feelings with the use of words - and can't fairly blame others for not getting what you mean until you've spoken calmly and clearly. 3. You learn that - remarkably - you do sometimes get things wrong. With huge courage, you take your first faltering steps towards (once in a while) apologising. 4. You learn to be confident not by realising that you're great, but by learning that everyone else is just as stupid, scared and lost as you are. We're all making it up as we go along, and that's fine. 5. You forgive your parents because you realise that they didn't put you on this earth in order to insult you. They were just painfully out of their depth and struggling with demons of their own. Anger turns, at points, to pity and compassion. 6. You learn the enormous influence of so-called 'small' things on mood: bed-times, blood sugar and alcohol levels, degrees of background stress etc. And as a result, you learn never to bring up an important, contentious issue with a loved one until everyone is well rested, no one is drunk, you've had some food, nothing else is alarming you and you aren't rushing to catch a train. 7. You give up sulking. If someone hurts you, you don't store up the hatred and the hurt for days. You remember you'll be dead soon. You don't expect others to know what's wrong. You tell them straight and if they get it, you forgive them. And if they don't, in a different way, you forgive them too. 8. You cease to believe in perfection in pretty much every area. There aren't any perfect people, perfect jobs or perfect lives. Instead, you pivot towards an appreciation of what is (to use the psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott's exemplary phrase) 'good enough.' You realise that many things in your life are at once quite frustrating - and yet, in many ways, eminently good enough. 9. You learn the virtues of being a little more pessimistic about how things will turn out - and as a result, emerge as a calmer, more patient and more forgiving soul. You lose some of your idealism and become a far less maddening person (less impatient, less rigid, less angry). 10. You learn to see that everyone's weaknesses of character are linked to counter-balancing strengths. Rather than isolating their weaknesses, you look at the whole picture: yes, someone is rather pedantic, but they're also beautifully precise and a rock at times of turmoil. Yes someone is a bit messy, but at the same time brilliantly creative and very visionary. You realise (truly) that perfect people don't exist - and that every strength will be tagged with a weakness. 11. You fall in love a bit less easily. It's difficult, in a way. When you were less mature, you could develop a crush in an instant. Now, you're poignantly aware that everyone, however externally charming or accomplished, would be a bit of a pain from close up. You develop loyalty to what you already have. 12. You learn that you are - rather surprisingly - quite a difficult person to live with. You shed some of your earlier sentimentality towards yourself. You go into friendships and relationships offering others kindly warnings of how and when you might prove a challenge. 13. You learn to forgive yourself for your errors and foolishness. You realise the unfruitful self-absorption involved in simply flogging yourself for past misdeeds. You become more of a friend to yourself. Of course you're an idiot, but you're still a loveable one, as we all are. 14. You learn that part of what maturity involves is making peace with the stubbornly child-like bits of you that will always remain. You cease trying to be a grown up at every occasion. You accept that we all have our regressive moments - and when the inner two year old you rears its head, you greet them generously and give them the attention they need. 15. You cease to put too much hope in grand plans for the kind of happiness you expect can last for years. You celebrate the little things that go well. You realise that satisfaction comes in increments of minutes. You're delighted if one day passes by without too much bother. You take a greater interest in flowers and in the evening sky. You develop a taste for small pleasures. 16. What people in general think of you ceases to be such a concern. You realise the minds of others are muddled places and you don't try so hard to polish your image in everyone else's eyes. What counts is that you and one or two others are OK with you being you. You give up on fame and start to rely on love. 17. You get better at hearing feedback. Rather than assuming that anyone who criticises you is either trying to humiliate you or is making a mistake, you accept that maybe it would be an idea to take a few things on board. You start to see that you can listen to a criticism and survive it - without having to put on your armour and deny there was ever a problem. 18. You realise the extent to which you tend to live, day by day, in too great a proximity to certain of your problems and issues. You remember - more and more - that you need to get perspective on things that pain you. You take more walks in nature, you might get a pet (they don't fret like we do) and you appreciate the distant galaxies above us in the night sky. 19. You recognise how your distinctive past colours your response to events - and learn to compensate for the distortions that result. You accept that, because of how your childhood went, you have a predisposition to exaggerate in certain areas. You become suspicious of your own first impulses around particular topics. You realise - sometimes - not to go with your feelings. 20. When you start a friendship, you realise that other people don't principally want to know your good news, so much as gain an insight into what troubles and worries you, so that they can in turn feel less lonely with the pains of their own hearts. You become a better friend because you see that what friendship is really about is a sharing of vulnerability. Our Emotional Barometer is a tool to help us more clearly explain our moods.

    "Title": "Why Maslow's Hierarchy Of Needs Matters",
    "Transcript": "One of the most legendary ideas in the history of psychology is located in an unassuming triangle divided into five sections referred to universally simply as 'Maslow's Pyramid of Needs'.This profoundly influential pyramid first saw the world in an academic journal in the United States in 1943, where it was crudely drawn in black and white and surrounded by dense and jargon-rich text. It has since become a mainstay of psychological analyses, business presentations and TED Talks – and grown ever more colourful and emphatic in the process.The pyramid was the work of a thirty-five year old Jewish psychologist of Russian origins called Abraham Maslow, who had been looking, since the start of his professional career, for nothing less than the meaning of life. No longer part of the close-knit orthodox family of his youth, Maslow wanted to find out what could make life purposeful for people (himself included) in modern-day America, a country where the pursuit of money and fame seemed to have eclipsed any more interior or authentic aspirations. He saw psychology as the discipline that would enable him to answer the yearnings and questions that people had once taken to religion. He suddenly saw that human beings could be said to have essentially five different kinds of need: on the one hand, the psychological or what one could term, without any mysticism being meant by the word, the spiritual and on the other, the material. For Maslow, we all start with a set of utterly non-negotiable and basic physiological needs, for food, water, warmth and rest. In addition, we have urgent safety needs for bodily security and protection from attack. But then we start to enter the spiritual domain. We need belongingness and love. We need friends and lovers, we need esteem and respect. And lastly, and most grandly, we are driven by what Maslow called – in a now legendary term – an urge for self-actualization: a vast, touchingly nebulous and yet hugely apt concept involving what Maslow described as 'living according to one's full potential' and 'becoming who we really are.'  Part of the reason why the description of these needs, laid out in pyramid-form, has proved so persuasive is their capacity to capture, with elemental simplicity, a profound structural truth about human existence. Maslow was putting his finger, with unusual deftness and precision, on a set of answers to very large questions that tend to confuse and perplex us viciously, particularly when we are young, namely: What are we really after? What do we long for? And how do we arrange our priorities and give due regard for the different and competing claims we have on our attention? Maslow was reminding us with artistic concision of the shape of an ideal well-lived life, proposing at once that we cannot live by our spiritual callings alone, but also that it cannot be right to remain focused only on the material either. We need, to be whole, both the material and the spiritual realms to be attended to, the base lending support while the summit offers upward direction and definition. Maslow was rebutting calls from two kinds of zealots: firstly, over-ardent spiritual types who might urge us to forget entirely about money, housing, a good insurance policy and enough to pay for lunch. But he was also fighting against extreme hard-nosed pragmatists who might imply that life was simply a brute process of putting food on the table and going to the office. Both camps had – for Maslow – misunderstood the complexity of the human animal. Unlike other creatures, we truly are multifaceted, called at once to unfurl our soul according to its inner destiny – and to make sure we can pay the bills at the end of the month. Operating at the heyday of American capitalism, Maslow was interestingly ambivalent about business. He was awed by the material resources of large corporations around him but at the same time he lamented that almost all their economic activity was – unfairly and bizarrely – focused on honouring customers' needs at the bottom of his pyramid. America's largest companies were helping people to have a roof of their heads, feeding them, moving them around and ensuring they could talk to each other long-distance. But they seemed utterly uninterested in trying to fulfill the essential spiritual appetites defined on the higher slopes of his pyramid. Towards the end of his long life, Maslow expressed a hope that businesses could in time learn to make more of their profits from addressing not only our basic needs but also – and as importantly – our higher spiritual and psychological ones as well. That would be truly enlightened capitalism. In the personal sphere, Maslow's pyramid remains a hugely useful object to turn to whenever we are trying to assess the direction of our lives. Often, as we reflect upon it, we start to notice that we really haven't arranged and balanced our needs as wisely and elegantly as we might. Some lives have got an implausibly wide base: all the energy seems directed towards material accumulation. At the same time, there are lives with the opposite problem, where we have not paid due head to our need to look after our fragile and vulnerable bodies. Maslow was pointing us to the need for a greater balance between the many priorities we must juggle. His beautifully simple visual cue is, above anything else, a portrait of a life lived in harmony with the complexities of our nature. We should, at our less frantic moments, use it to reflect with newfound focus on what it is we might do next.

    "Title": "Why Did They End the Relationship?",
    "Transcript": "They've gone – and what we need most of all to understand is why? What is striking is that, despite what friends and well-meaning acquaintances tell us, we already know. It is us. We firmly and naturally assume that the explanation is primarily to do with us and our miserable failings. They've gone because we weren't good enough. They got to know us better than almost anyone has ever done – and then, inevitably, felt horrified by the truth. It's not the relationship that failed: we failed. But – counterintuitively – what seems most obvious to us in our hearts might not actually be true in reality. There is a famous experiment in the history of psychology which pinpoints our tendency to project: that is, to read decisive, clear explanations drawn from our minds into what are in fact ambiguous situations in the world. The Thematic Apperception test, as it's technically known, was developed in the 1930s by the American psychologist Henry Murray. It presents us with images of people – and asks us to say what's going on in them.People tend to come to quite specific conclusions. For example: She'd fed up with him; he's weak and a bit boring and she's just told him that their relationship isn't working and that she's leaving. He's just told her they have to break up and the reason has something to do with their sex lives. He's not as fulfilled as he wants to be. It seems to be about his parents. She wants him to take more distance from them. If he doesn't, she can't be expected to stay around forever… The power of the experiment derives from the fact that the image has, by design, no precise or definite significance: they're just actors asked to assume certain poses. The stories and the meanings come from us. This is often exactly what happens around our own heartbreaks. We may never actually know precisely why the other person left us. That shouldn't be surprising. However well we know someone, they are never fully transparent to us. What they say may only be a part of what's really in their minds. Their deeper motives will remain obscure – perhaps even to them. We're presented with a fact – they've left us – and onto that we project a meaning. But the meaning we give to that fact comes, in large part, from us. Holding onto the idea that we don't actually know something is an underused and powerful skill. At one of the foundational moment of philosophy, in ancient Athens, Socrates argued that a huge component of wisdom lies in our capacity to accept our ignorance in certain situations: 'the wise are those who know that they don't know'. This recognition of not-knowing, and the reminder of our tendency to project, may be helpful in easing us away form the more catastrophic and self-incriminating interpretations of a break up. The lover who furiously told us they never wanted to see us again may – in the hidden recesses of their soul – have been actually thinking: 'I'm so sad this didn't work out; I wish I could find a way to make this work; you are so lovely in many ways, but there's something desperate in me that's turning away from your offer of love'. The person who coldly texts us: 'that's it, I'm out' may behind the scenes be weeping at their own sense of loss and failure rather than (as we imagine) gleefully celebrating the end of their over-extended encounter with us. The person who says: 'I wish this could work but just for now I've got to concentrate on my career' might actually be quite sincere rather than (as we might darkly suppose) putting a polite cover over their contempt for us. The acceptance of ambiguity is liberating: we're free to recognise that the ending wasn't necessarily all our fault; that there may have been forces at work other than our own inadequacy. We're still very sad, but the target of our misery is a little more bearable: we can focus on the deep, sorrowful strangeness of love and loss rather than suffering an extended excoriating confrontation with our own inadequacies. To learn more about love try our set of cards that help answer that essential question; \"Who should I be with?\""

    "Title": "What to Talk About on a Date",
    "Transcript": "Our initial impulse might be to pick up on a current event, some detail of the environment or a few impressive things about our careers. But if a date is at heart an audition for the emotional capacities required for the success of a long-term relationship, the real purpose of conversation must be to try to understand the deep self of the other person. We know we will be doing well if, at a certain point, our date reflects that they've never been asked so many psychologically-weighty questions – and are we perhaps some sort of psychotherapist in training…? Such comments playfully reflect how comparatively surface most chat ends up being and how unnerving and yet delightful it can be to sense that for once the focus of another's interest is firmly on the details of our souls. This is some of what we might ask in an attempt to take the measure of another's deeper self: – What has made you cry in recent times? We're not only concerned with what goes well for them; we're accepting of, and curious about their reversals. We know there are painful sides of life for everyone, we're not going to insist on levity or deny them the right to grieve. We'll also be sure to tell them in turn what brings tears to our eyes. – What was difficult in your childhood? Without anyone meaning for this to happen, parents inevitably bruise and damage their children. With a light touch, we're trying to get a sense of their particular take on the drama of growing up. All of us end up a little distorted by our experiences: over-vigilant or too relaxed; too concerned with money or overly indifferent to material goods; frightened of sex or excessively decadent. They won't be unique in having been messed up, we're clear on this score, but their disturbances will be fascinatingly specific to them. We're signalling that understanding their child self will be vital to grasping how they behave and who they are as adults. It will also lay down a reserve of compassion at moments when their adult selves are overwhelmed by the dynamics of the past. – What do you regret? Our lives are crucially defined by the roads that weren't taken, by the choices we bungled, by the situations we ruminate upon in the early hours. Because there is such a risk of humiliation in revealing where we messed up, if we can be a patient and compassionate listener, we will be doing something for our date that almost no one has ever done for them – at least outside of a professional therapeutic context. We will be gifting them the honour of feeling heard for their mistakes and of being reassured that these are just an inevitable feature of being human; it will be a luxury far greater than being taken to a fancy restaurant or roof-top bar. Fourthly – To whom would you like to go back and apologise? An associated enquiry, this one focuses on the guilt we accumulate as we stumble through our lives. It's a question that both leaves room for confession – and offers atonement. – What would you want someone to forgive you for? Gently, we're probing at what they know is tricky in their own characters. We aren't brutally asking what is wrong with them (they'd take offence). We're inviting them to admit to one or two ways in which they have noticed that they can cause difficulties for others. We'll need to have some examples of our own follies to confess to straight after. – What have your exes not understood about you? Their past relationships are the vital repositories of clues as to the success of their future ones. We're wondering how well they can pinpoint what went wrong and whether failure has provided them with an occasion to learn rather than merely lament or blame. – What would you ideally want to tell your mother? And your father? There might be tears at the thought. There can be so much buried sorrow in the history we share with two people on earth we tend to love and hate in almost equal measure – and owe so much to. We will listen to what parents were too brittle, too defensive or too proud to hear. It'll be everything that never comes out at family gatherings, but so badly needs to be aired. – In what ways do you feel like a bit of an impostor at work? We're normalising that we all invariably feel like we don't entirely measure up to what is expected of us professionally. We're providing a refuge for a sense of incompetence that we take such pains to hide from the world in normal circumstances. We're inviting our date, at last, to let down their guard. Having exchanged these questions, and others like them, over many hours, we may feel something odd starting to happen: we may sense ourselves falling a little in love. The process isn't mysterious. It's just that we're getting to know one another's deeper selves, with all the longings, errors, terrors, regrets, weaknesses and fears involved. There is simply nothing more seductive than this kind of mutual self-revelation, love being in large part the gratitude we register when we feel accepted and seen – as well as the compassion we experience when another person lets down their defences and trusts at last that someone is going to be kind to them.

    "Title": "How to Become Someone People Will Confide In",
    "Transcript": "It is a mark of character to be thought of as someone that others can safely confide in; there is a high degree of empathy, generosity and open-mindedness implied in being the person that friends instinctively turn to when everything has gone dark. But we may come to realise that, despite our best intentions, often others do not quite see us in this way. If we ask them directly what the matter is, they try to look cheerful and insist that everything is fine. We know it can't be but nor do they seem inclined to open up to us. We end up lonely and a little helpless. There are plenty of good reasons why people tend to show extreme care before opening up. A confidant may turn out to be patronising, alarmist, sentimental, panic-inducing or moralistic. The dangers of humiliation can be acute. To dare to confide, we need a strong feeling that our companion is going to be unreservedly understanding, gentle and kindly. But even if we feel ready to be all these things, how do we signal our capacities properly to others people? The almost touchingly obvious method is via direct assertion. We might say: don't worry, I won't judge or simply: you can tell me, I'm very understanding. Kind though such statements may be, they can't generally help because they don't touch the core fear that – whatever we may say – we may still turn out to be disturbed by, or hostile to, the details of actual revelations. The more skilled approach requires a greater degree of courage on our part. It involves regularly admitting to something difficult and troubling and rather shameful about ourselves. It's by letting others know something of our own vulnerabilities that we free them up to share some of the things they are terrified of admitting in their lives. Our revelation proves far better than a headline statement that we are reliable because we know from the inside what it's like to carry a dreadful secret and to feel frightened of another person's reaction to it. We're demonstrating a crucial idea: that we won't turn on them because we've trusted them not to turn on us. The process of building up trust often functions in an incremental way: we reveal a small and not too awful fact about us, and the other then starts to share a little of what's going on for them. From there, we take a bolder step of admitting to something more significantly awkward: something we know could be seen as really not very acceptable. We're inviting the other to follow us in turn and to feel secure in opening their hearts yet wider. ©Flickr/Cabin Events The underlying idea is that in order to demonstrate our position as an empathetic receiver of confidences, we have to show our broken and flawed sides: we've failed, so another can tell us of their failure; we've been hurt so, they can admit to being hurt; we've done, and admitted we've done, very stupid things so we're not going to turn against those who have also been at points very silly. To be a good companion, it isn't enough simply to be polite or to commiserate. We need to take a risk. We need to give our friends something they could use against us – so that they can feel safe in giving us something we might use against them. Under the umbrella of mutually assured destruction, real trust and friendship can then flourish.

    "Title": "Arguments When There Is Too Little Sex",
    "Transcript": "It could, on the surface, be an argument about almost anything: what time to leave for the airport, who forgot to post the tax form, where to send the children to school… But, in reality, in disguise, unmentioned and unmentionable, it is typically the very same argument, the no-sex argument, the single greatest argument that ever afflicts committed couples, the argument which has powered more furious oblique exchanges among lovers than any other, the argument that right now, explains why one person is angrily refusing to speak to another over a bowl of Udon noodles in a restaurant in downtown Yokohama and another is screaming in an apartment on an upper floor of a block in the suburbs of Belo Horizonte, why a child has acquired a step-parent and a person is crying over a bottle or at their therapist's office. The real injury – you have ceased to want me and I can no longer bear myself or you – can't be mentioned because it cuts us too deep; it threatens too much of our dignity, it is bigger than we are. In the darkness late at night, time after time, our hand moved towards theirs, tried to coax them into a caress and was turned down. They held our fingers limply for a moment and then, as if we were the monster we now take ourselves to be, curled away from us and disappeared into the warren of sleep. We have stopped trying now. It may happen once in a blue moon, a few times a year, but we understand the score well enough: we are not wanted. We feel like outcasts, the only ones to be rejected in this way, the victims of a rare disease; nursing an emotional injury far too shaming to mention to others let alone ourselves, the only ones not be having sex in a happy sex-filled world. Our anger aggravates our injury and traps us in cycles of hostility. Perhaps they don't want us in the night because we have been so vile in the day; but so long as our hand goes unwanted, we can never muster the courage to be anything but vindictive in their presence. It hurts more than being single, when at least the neglect was to be expected. This is a sentence without end. We can neither complain, nor let the issue go. We feel compelled to fight by proxy about anything we can lay our hands on: the washing powder and the walk to the park, the money for the dentist and the course of the nation's politics, all because we so badly need to be held and to hold, to penetrate or to be penetrated. It is in a sense deeply strange, even silly that so much should hang on this issue, that the future of families, the fate of children, the division of assets, the survival of a friendship group, should depend on the right sort of frottage of a few centimetres of our upper limbs. It's the tiniest thing and at the same time the very largest. The absence of sex matters so much because sex itself is the supreme conciliator and salve of all conflict, ill-feeling, loneliness and disinterest. It is almost impossible to make love and be sad, indifferent or bitter. Furious perhaps, in a passionate and ardent way. But not – almost always – truly elsewhere or beset by major grievance. The act forces presence, vulnerability, honesty, tenderness, release. It matters inordinately because it is the ultimate proof that everything is, despite everything, still OK. As ever, so much would change if only we could be helped to find the words, if we could fight our way past our shame, if we didn't have to feel so alone (this should be proof enough that we aren't); if we could point to the problem without fury, without humiliation, without defensiveness; if we could simply name our desperation without becoming desperate, if the one who didn't want it could explain in terms that made sense and were bearable and the one who felt cast aside could explain without surrendering to vindictiveness or despair. We would ideally, alongside physics and geography, learn the basics of all this in our last year at high school, learn how to spot and assuage the no-sex argument with an in-depth course and regular refreshments throughout our lives. It is the paradigm of all arguments. Those who can get over it can get over pretty much any dispute; those who cannot must squabble to the grave. Were our species to learn how to do this, the world would be suddenly and decisively calmer: there would be infinitely fewer fights, alcoholic outbursts, divorces, affairs, rages, denunciations, recriminations, civil wars, armed conflicts and nuclear conflagrations. At the first signs of no-sex arguments, couples would know how carefully to locate the words that could address their sorrow. There would not always be an answer but there would always be the right sort of conversation – and, on a good day, the endurance of love.

    "Title": "Why We Sometimes Try to Make Our Partner Sad",
    "Transcript": "There is a kind of argument that begins with one partner deliberately – and for no immediately obvious reason – attempting to spoil the good mood and high spirits of the other. The cheerful partner may be cooking a cake for their visiting nephew or whistling a tune while they rearrange the kitchen. They may be making plans for the weekend or discussing what fun it will be to see an old school friend again soon. Or they may be expressing unusual optimism about their professional future and financial prospects. Despite our love for them, something about the situation may suddenly grate with us. Within a short time, we may find ourselves saying something unusually harsh or critical: we may point out a flaw with their school friend (they tell very boring anecdotes, they can be pretty snobbish); we may take exception to the arrangement of the cupboards; we find fault with the cake; we bring up an aspect of their work that we know our partner finds dispiriting; we complain that they haven't properly considered the roadworks when planning the weekend. We do everything to try to induce a mood of anxiety, friction and misery. On the surface it looks as if we're simply monsters. But if we dig a little deeper, a more understandable (though no less regrettable) picture may emerge. We are acting in this way because our partner's buoyant and breezy mood can come across as a forbidding barrier to communication. We fear that their current happiness could prevent them from knowing the shame or melancholy, worry or loneliness that presently possess us. We are trying to shatter their spirits because we are afraid of being lonely. We don't make this argument explicitly to ourselves but a dark instinct in our minds experiences their upbeat mood as a warning that the uncheery parts of ourselves must now be unwelcome. And so we make a crude, wholly immature but psychologically comprehensible assumption that we will never be properly known and loved until our partner can feel as sad and frustrated as we do, a recalibration of mood that we put into motion with malicious determination. But of course, the truth is quite the contrary. We may succeed in making our partner upset but we almost certainly won't thereby secure the imagined benefits of their gloom: they won't – once their mood has been spoilt – emerge with any greater appetite for listening to our messages of distress or for cradling us indulgently in their consoling arms. They will just be furious. The better move – if only we could manage it – would be to confess to, rather than act out, our impulses. We would learn to get to know the mechanisms of our immaturity with unfrightened curiosity while making every effort to protect others from its effects. We would admit to our partner that we had been seized by an ugly fear about the consequences of their happiness, would laughingly reveal how much we would ideally love to cause a stink, and would firmly pledge that we naturally aren't about to. We would all the while remind ourselves that every cheerful person has been sad and that the buoyant among us have by far the best chances of keeping afloat those who remain emotionally at sea. The spoiling argument is a wholly paradoxical plea for love that leaves one party ever further from the tenderness and shared insight they crave. Knowing to spot the phenomenon should lead us – when we are the ones baking or whistling a tune – to remember that the person attempting to ruin our mood isn't perhaps just a monster (though they are a bit of that too); they are, childishly but sincerely, worried that our happiness may come at their expense and are, through their remorseless negativity, in a garbled and maddening way, begging us for reassurance.

    "Title": "How to Cope With an Avoidant Partner",
    "Transcript": "There are, for many of us, few people as attractive as the avoidant; the sort that are permanently a little mysterious; who don't speak so much; around whom one never quite knows where one is; in whose eyes there is a faraway look, and perhaps a certain melancholy too; in whose hearts we intuit a sadness we long to, but never quite can, touch; people who seem to promise us intimacy and connection, and yet who remain – however long we have been with them – mesmerisingly unreassuring. Unsurprisingly, it is not so easy to be the lover of an avoidant person. The tendency, very often, after the heady early days, is to give into the insecurities they end up provoking in us: do they really care? Do they love us back? Why are they never the ones to call? Beset by such questions, we may get cross, tearful or stern. We may accuse them of neglect and selfishness, of betrayal or egocentricity. These sort of inquisitions can be counted on to fail. At the first signs of critique, avoidant people pull up the drawbridge. They are experts at fleeing the messy consequences of other people's desire for them. They go off to play sport, abscond on a long journey or discover new responsibilities at the office. One is left hammering in vain at the gates of their personal citadel. On a bad day, they may also get furious back. They will deny that we have any kind of point at all. They aren't trying to deceive us; they genuinely can't see the issue. They aren't – they assure us with mounting vehemence – distant and cold, they are simply busy and not into certain kinds of sentimentality. It is we – needy, weak, hysterical and over-demanding, as they put it – who are the problem. We almost agree. To survive, we should hold on to the idea that, despite their robust outward manner, the avoidant are, above all else, scared. Their frostiness is the result of fear rather than indifference – and what they are afraid of is to let down their guard and then meet with betrayal and abandonment. Their outward strength masks a gelatinous interior. There will, inevitably, be a rather touching backstory to their advanced subterranean fears. They were, way back, most likely let down very badly by someone they depended on a lot when they were defenceless. In response to a grave childhood disappointment, they grew an extra thick skin and plated themselves with armour. They vowed, in a way they may not now even recognise, never to trust anyone fully again. Related image So they are distant and prone to put up barriers not because they don't care, but because being cared for with kindness generates unfamiliar and daunting feelings for them. They skillfully undermine their chances of being close, because they have no experience of reliable love – and are drawn to try to spoil it to prove to themselves that it can't be real (and that they haven't, therefore, missed out on quite so much). We should avoid getting stuck in cycles of claim and counter-claim; that they might be too cold and that we might be too hot. Far better to address the fears circulating beneath the surface. Rather than provoking their panic or denial, we should – as best we can – make closeness feel safe. We should remember that we are dealing with someone who finds vulnerability frightening and therefore not meet their impulse to flee with punitiveness. But more crucially, we might along the way, start to ask ourselves a few key questions. How similar are we to them, beneath the apparent differences? It is easy to claim that one has an uncomplicated desire to be close – so long as one isn't put to the test, because one has carefully picked out a person who has problems being so. Yet in truth, how simple is closeness for us really? Might we not be as scared as they are – but simply have passed our share of the problem on to them to hold? Shouldn't we be suspicious of the way that we managed to reject other warmer candidates in favour of this distant figure? Is it really an accident that we are with them? Or isn't it in some way satisfying to us as well, allowing us to claim that we want intimacy without having to bear any of its costs? Through such pointed questions, we stand to realise that, most probably, the fear of closeness exists on both sides. It's just that they are directly distant and we are so by proxy. We can break away from caricatures and, as a couple, own up to our mutual terrors of dependence. We can start to sympathise with one another's techniques for warding off anxiety and help each other to accept the common risks of love. That will be the beginning of true closeness – and bravery – on both sides. Did you know we also have an app to help you meet people with whom you can have deeper more meaningful connections?

    "Title": "Why Touch Matters so Much in Love",
    "Transcript": "We live in an age increasingly prepared to see hurtful aspects lurking within many apparently so-called minor situations, and ready to lend greater public acknowledgement to what had previously been merely private pains. It is in this context that we should give due recognition to a truly grave hurt that can unfold, within established relationships, when there is almost no touch left between the parties, when one partner repeatedly moves to hold the other's hand, or perhaps caress their shoulder or waist – and receives no response at all, or a subtle turn away and withdrawal. We're not talking here of the more obvious and well-known problem of a lack of sex (though this may be present too), but of the long-term and arguably equally serious or even greater hurt that can ensue when one partner's body as a whole becomes somehow unreceptive to, or uninterested in, the other's touch. We know, of course, how much this is awkward on an early date. We're ready, at a cultural level, to give due weight to a minor physical rejection when it happens around a potential new partner. But there is as much loneliness and agony within settled couples around unheld hands, except that here it feels a great deal more embarrassing and more humiliating even to raise the issue. Perplexingly, the very person who quietly withdraws their hand or leaves it agonisingly limp in our own, can also be the one who is named in our will, with whom we share a mortgage and to whom we have given over our emotional lives. How devastating to self-confidence an inert hand can be in this situation. Lifeless in ours, it plays into every anxiety about unacceptability, exploitation and rejection. But precisely because it is so devastating, it becomes impossibly hard to discuss in any fruitful way. We are liable either to say nothing at all, or else to express our hurt through bitterness and sarcasm. We cannot stay long enough with the pain we feel to share it – and try to correct it – with the partner themselves. We may find it wholly beyond us to develop the authority, self-belief and legitimacy to say: you didn't take my hand after dinner, you never touch me of your own accord – and it is driving me slowly but definitively insane. We don't have this kind of offence mapped on our chart of acceptable verbalisable unhappiness, it doesn't feel like a toll we have a language for or the right to. And yet, we should, despite our anxieties, retain the courage and conviction of our feelings. An inert hand or a lack of touch, is truly as serious a problem as we feel it is. The request to be held and physically acknowledged is a subject of deep gravity, rooted in our capacity to tolerate and like ourselves. We should not compound our misery by a sense that we are not allowed to feel or share it. Then, when we can manage it, we should learn to pick up the partner's hand with a newfound confidence and say that the little flinch or inertness we feel when we do so is a huge problem for us, that what they may blithely dismiss as 'this touching business' is part of why we're in a relationship in the first place, that it matters as much as anything else does to us and that if they care at all for us or the continuance of the union, then they will have to take the pain on board at last. We should have the bravery finally to know in our hearts that this 'small' thing is not small at all: it may be quite simply integral to how we know we're loved – and how and when we feel we're not. Love is a skill that we can learn.  Our relationships book calmly guides us with calm and charm through the key issues of relationships.

    "Title": "How To Fight In Love",
    "Transcript": "There are couples that seem never to argue. Their relationships are marked by enormous outward politeness; they say thank you a lot; they make each other cups of tea; they can look rather horrified when there's a mention of a squabble in someone else's life. It's understandable if they're privately a little pleased with themselves. But surface harmony isn't, in reality, any reliable sign of health in love because it's impossible to try to merge two lives without regularly encountering deep sources of incompatibility. A lack of arguments is more likely to be a sign that we have given up caring than a superhuman achievement of maturity. The goal isn't, therefore, to do away with arguments – but to find our way towards their more fruitful variety. We need to learn to argue well, rather than not argue at all. What then are some of the ideas that might help us have better arguments? 1. The single greatest idea that can help us to argue more constructively is to remind ourselves publicly that we are – both of us – by nature deeply imperfect and at points quite plainly mad. The enemy of mature arguments is self-righteousness: the sense that we might be beyond fault and that our partner must be either wicked for making a mistake or unfairly critical in alleging that we have been guilty of one. It is of immense benefit if relationships can be conducted under the assumed truth that both participants are idiotic, mentally wobbly, quite flawed in manifold ways – and constantly in need of forgiveness. It's an implicit faith in our own perfection that turns us into monsters. 2. People concede points not when they're aggressively told they're wrong; but when they feel loved. We get stubborn and withhold the truth when we're scared and suspect that the person challenging us hates us, means us harm, can never forgive us – and is perhaps about to leave us. It is indispensable to preface every criticism with an assurance of our ongoing love. 3. People change very slowly, and seldom when they are harassed into doing so. We must strive not to be desperate for change. We must make our peace with the idea that they won't evolve as we would wish on the timescale that would suit us; we should be rather pessimistic about human nature in order to encounter one or two grounds for hope. 4. We shouldn't aggravate our frustration by a sense that we have been uniquely cursed in ending up in this relationship. Of course they are annoying. Everyone in the world would be equally tricky at times and often probably a lot worse. The specifics of why we're in an irritating dispute may be local but that we are in one is a universal destiny. We should laugh darkly at the human tragedy. 5. Our partner is only ever frightened, worried and not thinking straight – rather than bad. Just like us, they carry a lot of emotional baggage: they have been shaped by their complex and at moments very troubled history. Much of what they do isn't directly about us but is a way of coping with difficulties that came into their life long before we met them. 6. Choose the moment. We can be under the illusion that arguing is an exchange of intellectual ideas. But it's largely a process reliant on our emotions and is decisively influenced by such easily-overlooked matters as how much sleep we've had, how much we've drunk and what time it is. As a general rule, wait till tomorrow. 7. Don't let the relationship die from misplaced 'politeness' or embarrassment. Dare to name the problem, however shocking it sounds. As long as it's been carefully wrapped in layers of love, the truth is normally bearable to those who care for us. 8. It doesn't matter if we're right. We must be prepared to forego all the pleasures of proving a point. We're not not trying to 'win' but to live as happily as possible with another person who is, in the end, our best friend and on our side. Despite this, we will still have furious rows of course, we will call each other the worst things, slam doors and cry. It's hugely normal. The capacity to be horrible to a partner is even a strange – though genuine – feature of love. A relationship has to include the madder, more unreasonable parts of our nature; if we are only ever polite, it's because we have not been made to feel safe. A row may have to be the turbulent passage towards the kind of deeper reconciliation we long for. It can be important to say some wild and hurtful things to halt a drift apart. By foregrounding for a while the most extreme points of conflict, we set up the conditions for reconnecting with larger areas of closeness. We now remember that, despite an evening squabbling like the frightened, foolish, barely semi-rational idiots we are, we love them deeply nevertheless – and will strive with all our will (and the help of the odd film like this) to argue a little more sensibly next time.

    "Title": "How to Be Attractive on a Date",
    "Transcript": "The goal can be stated simply enough: the overwhelming priority, when on a date with someone we like, is to persuade them to like us back. But the simplicity of the mission masks the complexity required to achieve it. Typically, the advice focuses on externals: what to wear, when to unfurl a napkin, what to order… But such counsel, however well-meaning, is at odds with what we ourselves know about attraction: that it is profoundly focused on psychology. However much we may deny it to friends, a date is ultimately a search for a potential long term-partner. So what really renders someone attractive on dates are signs that they are emotionally well-equipped for what good-enough long-term relationships require. The capacity to find an ideal full-bodied Chianti on a menu may be impressive, but what we're really alert for are signs that someone is going to be a decent companion twenty years from now when we have received a difficult medical diagnosis or are feeling weepy and ashamed at the progress of our careers. Here then are some of the things we might do to prove attractive to another person on a date: i. Tell them that we are a bit mad. We might, in the course of the conversation, light-heartedly drop in that we're not quite sane. Perhaps we have great difficulty getting to sleep or get very anxious in social situations. Maybe we are often deeply sad on Sunday evenings or have a painful rivalrous relationship with a sibling. The key is that, as we reveal these vulnerabilities, we can suggest we have a mature, compassionate, unruffled relationship to them. Yes, we may be a little mad, but we are eminently sane enough to know about and be unfrightened of our follies; we have mapped them, are able to warn others of them and can protect those we love from their worst sides. What we require in a partner is not someone who is perfect, but someone with a good handle on their manifold imperfections – who can warn us of these in good time, and not act them out in ways that will ruin our lives. © Flickr/Quinn Dombrowski It is deeply reassuring to witness vulnerability well-worn and madness confidently understood; to see someone mature enough to talk about their immaturities in an undefended and serenely curious way. Over the long-term, every possible partner will be revealed as rather crazy in some dimension of existence or another. So what really counts is not whether or not they are psychologically complicated, but how they relate to this complexity: the degree of insight, calm, perspective and humour they can bring to bear upon it. Conversely, there should be nothing more terrifying on a date than a person who sticks a little too aggressively to the idea that they are totally sane and entirely normal. Anyone over the age of twenty possessed of the idea that they are 'easy to live with' has evidently not begun to understand themselves or their impact on others. We should probably skip desert and head home early. ii. Ask our partners how they are a bit mad The enquiry should sound playful, natural and wholly compassionate. Having laid out our flaws of character, we should take it as a given that – despite their evident strengths and accomplishments – our date too will have a litany of their own madder sides. We should create a safe space in which we imply that it is extremely unsurprising that our date should be a bit 'broken' in certain areas; everyone is. We can gently enquire into what makes them in particular anxious or depressed, what was untenably difficult in their childhoods or what they in particular regret and are ashamed of. This can prove charming because what we're ultimately looking for in love are not people who find us perfect, but people who will not flinch from the sight of our wounds. We want to be seen for who we really are and forgiven; not mistaken for someone else, idealised – and then one day condemned. © Flickr/Steven Guzzardi iii. Reveal we've been a bit lonely and sad lately We often assume that people want to hear that things are going brilliantly for us – and that we become winning for others when we can show we're triumphing in the world. But what really warms us to others is evidence that they share in some of the very difficulties and confusions that we are beset by in our private selves. If love involves a desire for an end to loneliness, then some of what we no longer want to be lonely with are our more melancholy dimensions that most people have no time for or interest in – and that we therefore have to take care to hide from others in a bid to look competent and strong. How seductive, therefore, to stumble on someone around whom we sense we will no longer have to be jolly in a brittle way; someone who can give us room, through their own candour, to confessions of feelings of loss and sorrow. There can be few things more charming on a date than to hear, from someone who looks extremely self-possessed and competent, that they've been feeling unusually isolated and very perplexed of late. They're showing us the fertilised soil in which our love can grow. iv. Pay some compliments We can, understandably, get anxious at the idea of having to pay our date some compliments. The approach can feel too direct, demanding, almost sleazy. But there is an art to good compliments that starts from a different place: a recognition that most of us struggle to maintain a basic grasp on what is decent and good about us, and privately hunger to hear from someone else certain basic but psychologically-sustaining things about our characters (that sound unbelievable when we try to say them to ourselves): that we aren't wholly stupid, that we are sometimes funny or perceptive and have a few qualities to contribute to the world. We can be so worried by our own inadequacies that we forget that the person across the table will have an equally large share of them – which it lies within our power to calm. These antics and more belong to a properly rich sense of what we might need to talk about on the audition of our lives we call, with touching modesty, a date. To learn more about love try our book on how to find love, which explains why we have the types we do and how our early experiences shape how and whom we love."

    "Title": "Existentialism and Dating",
    "Transcript": "Dating brings us close to a particular strand of philosophy that, the rest of the time, might not seem particularly relevant to our lives: existentialism. One of the movement's major proponents – Jean-Paul Sartre – developed a set of ideas that help explain, and give dignity to, the anxiety, excitement and at points vertigo we may experience as we go through the dating ritual. A key concept of Existentialism is expressed in Sartre's somewhat obscure but useful phrase: “Being precedes essence”. What Sartre meant by 'being' are the bits of our life that we are free to choose for ourselves: how we live, what job we do, how we conceive of what happens to us. And by 'essence', he refers to things that lie outside our command: our biological nature, the flow of history, the position of the stars… What Sartre wished to point out to us, in a spirit of wanting to liberate us from certain rigidities of mind, is that 'being' should ultimately be thought of as more important than 'essence'. However much we sometimes like to tell ourselves that things have to be the way they are, there are in fact many radically different possible versions of ourselves available to us; we can choose to an extraordinary extent how things might be for us. But much of the time, Sartre felt, we don't give this open-ended aspect of our identities enough space in our minds. We assert that the way we live is inevitable and fixed, and imply that we have no agency over our stories. But Sartre argues that this is an illusion: the kind of person we are right now developed as a result of all sorts of small and large decisions: it could have been very different, and may be different again in the future according to the way we exercise of our will upon the raw material of life. Surprisingly enough, it is dating that can bring home some of the richness of this dramatic existential insight. It is in our dating years that we feel, perhaps more than at any point before or since, how much our future is undefined, how little is preordained, how many options there really are; how frighteningly free and fluid things can be. With each date we're sketching – even if very lightly – a possible future. If our date on Wednesday goes well, we could conceivably be looking at (for instance) a life in which we have relatives in the highlands of Scotland, in which a lot of the people we spend time with are in the technology sector and in which we'll probably move country several times; we might in time also have a child called Hamish or Flora. Alternatively, if our date on Friday evening goes very well, we could be edging towards a life in which we'll be spending a lot of time in Amsterdam; we'll get drawn into the theatre world; if we have a child they might be called Maartje or Rem and they'll have a former cycling champion as a grandfather and an Indonesian grandmother. Once we make our choice, things may well start to seem as if they always had to be, that there was some essence that we were always moving towards, that we had to end up with little Maartje or sweet Flora crawling on the carpet towards us. But in the dating period, we are closer to a grander and more visceral truth: that there is no single script. Sartre's second big point is that properly recognising our freedom can lead us to a state of huge but inevitable and in a way salutary anxiety. Conscious of our real liberty, we take on board that we have to make decisions and yet, at the same time, that we will never have the correct and full information upon which to base them with the sort of perfect wisdom and foresight we might desire. We are steering largely blind, forced to make choices that ideally we'd leave to the Gods but that in a secular world, we have no option but to take on for ourselves. As we date, we may wonder: who should we settle for? For how long do we keep going? How can we tell whether this one or that one is right? Sartre's answer is that we can never properly know but that we are never more properly alive and authentic than when we are turning over such enquiries: the fluidity of our destinies is then palpable, with all the strangeness and wonder this implies. Too often, the sense of fluidity is lost. We assume that what is had to be and that we have no further choices left open to us. The dating years defy such views. No wonder if they feel like high stakes. Sartre wished to embolden us for the sort of challenges they present to us. Dating pushes aside the veil of our normal complacency and reveals the sublime, terrifying and, at the same time, thrilling uncertainty of existence. We should, with a host of existential challenges before us, at the very least, not be too bored.

    "Title": "How the Absence of Religion Has Changed Humanity",
    "Transcript": "The modern age is inherently anthropocentric in outlook, from “anthropos” Greek for human, that is it places human beings and their Experience and concerns at the center of the hierarchy. Above the claims of nature, animals, Gods or the universe more broadly. We are now in every way, in our own eyes the center of the show. But, it was not always like this, traditionally, religions declined to give human beings a central place in the cosmos, the ancient Greeks pictured their gods living on the summit of Mount Olympus and looking down upon humans with a mixture of amusement and pity. Zen Buddhism Interpreted nature with all its diverse flora and fauna as far more important than, any one kind of upright ape of questionable merit. And Judaism and Christianity, presented the world Theocentrically, with human life as a small, and in many ways not very impressive, fragment in a much larger scheme, known only to the infinitely superior mind of God. With the decline of religion, we have come to embrace the philosophy of anthropocentrism, We have identified ourselves as the most important things that exist. It's a move that can be cast as one of Liberation, the stories on which God focused societies were founded have been displaced, by more visceral tales of human heroism in business in science or in the arts. But this liberation has brought an unexpected kind of suffering in its wake, a vicious sense of our own lack of importance as compared with that of mightier other humans, a feeling that we don't matter really, when we actually should. All this is unleashed a torrent of envy and inadequacy. Theocentric or biocentric societies, cast all our eyes upwards and reminded us that we were, everyone of us in the wider scheme, ultimately puny and forgettable propositions. But in our times there is now no established point of reference beyond us that can matter, what happens to us here and now is framed as overwhelmingly important. It's all there is and so everything that goes wrong, everything that frustrates or disappoints us, fills the horizon of our being, the idea of something bigger, older, mightier, wiser and nobler than us to which we owe love and obedience has been stripped of its power to console us. But tough it can seem as if there is nothing left to awe, or relativize us. There is, what puts us in our place and reduces us in size, needn't be, as religions presumed gods alone. It might be the site of the stars at night, spread out in a mantle of Darkness, unaccountably many unimaginably distant and themselves constituting only an infinitesimal fraction of the cosmos. From their perspective, all human differences fade all our conflicts and competitions feel less urgent or significant. We are as nothing. Or, we might remember that we're not at the center of things on a more domestic scale when we meet a small animal, for example, a duck or a hedgehog its life goes on utterly oblivious to ours. It feels not the slightest curiosity about who we are from its point of view, we are absorbed into the immense blankness of incomprehensible things. A duck will take a piece of bread as gladly from a criminal, as from a high court judge, from a billionaire, as from a bankrupt felon, our Individuality is suspended and that can be an enormous relief. Nowadays, the sense that we are small and relatively unimportant in the universe is disorganized and fragmented, religions used to organize it, interpret it, ensure our regular contact with it, and gave it its proper status. They do continue to be opportunities to meet with this feeling, but they are haphazard. We should take care to take them when we can, whenever we feel overwhelmed, or punishingly self-absorbed, when there's a chance of a walk in the wilderness a look at the stars or a few moments with an animal. We should be keen to get back in touch with that all-important feeling that we are not, Thankfully, the center of the show. Our “Who Am I” journal is designed to help us create a psychological portrait of who we are, with the use of some far more unusual, entertaining and playful prompts along with bespoke psychological exercises to help develop our self understanding.

    "Title": "Who Initiates Sex and why it Matters so Much",
    "Transcript": "It can seem a highly trivial subject to get so upset about – being rightly no more significant than who should open the door first, or open a new jam jar first. And yet, judging from the heartache it tends to generate, it appears to matter very much indeed. It's at the root of many affairs, it is the catalyst for vicious arguments and bitterness, the long-term future of small children can be decided by it – and couples routinely end up in therapy or (more often) the divorce courts because of it. At the heart of the drama are all the complexities involved when, late at night, in the darkness, one person's hand moves over to tentatively touch the other's body in a way that signals a desire to initiate either sex or a cuddle – and nothing much happens in return. This move ends up being so much more fraught than one might imagine because it has so little to do with making love: it's about knowing that we are wanted. The willingness to initiate sex can appear like the litmus test of whether one is appreciated within the relationship as a whole – and therefore whether a couple remains a going concern or not. For one person never to initiate, or else merely to respond half-heartedly to caresses, is tantamount to declaring that they cannot possibly love the person they are with. ©Flickr/Roman Boed In truth, a lack of initiation or response can mean many things. It may, at points, simply be a sign of exhaustion after a long day of childcare or office work. Sometimes an untouched hand is just an untouched hand. The real problem in the ambiguous darkness of the bedroom is not a lack of reciprocation per se, it is the way that that ambiguity is interpreted: the way that assumptions are formed without discussion – and grave offence is taken without the topic having first been aired. Beneath this lies a more pernicious problem still: shame. Unreciprocated touch becomes properly dangerous when it comes into contact with a high degree of self-suspicion or self-hatred on the part of the person who has dared to slide their hand across. What might merely have been judged an innocent or temporary lack of enthusiasm comes to be taken – silently and automatically – as evidence of something far more catastrophic: proof that the other person finds one disgusting. Ideally, if we all loved ourselves enough, we would know better what to do when we moved a hand across and we did not get much in return: we would address the matter within the couple through calm and kindly discussion and tried to determine what was at stake. If the evidence pointed squarely to a profound lack of interest or emotional capacity, we would leave. After all, there is nothing wrong with ending up sharing a bed with an emotionally or physically withholding partner; there is something very wrong, or at least very unfortunate, with sticking around once one knows this is the case. ©Flickr/Joe Wolf But these are not options open to us when we feel overly ashamed. Our unresponsive partners reinforce pre-existing feelings of unacceptability that render us bitter, mute and fragile. A history of not knowing how to value ourselves makes it extremely difficult for us to complain effectively about unfortunate treatment – let alone leave in order to seek warmer lovers elsewhere. As self-hating lovers, we cannot say, with the requisite calm and strategic patience, that we feel rejected, need to be understood and are looking for change. We will either say nothing at all and might have an affair – or else explode into a rage that guarantees our message won't be heard. We won't have the courage to interrogate the signs and adroitly change the course of the relationship in response. In the tensions around unreciprocated touch, we catch sight of a more general problem in love: the difficulties created when we aren't able to ask for what we want in a relationship, when we suffer from a sense that we don't deserve to be content and cannot handle frustration or respond to our misery adequately. We should not leave the untouched hand for too long in the darkness. We should dare to switch on the light, express our pain and consider our options without shame."

of the School of Life she recently came to talk at our branch in London and she'll be back again in December Perel recognises the distinctive moment we're at in history where we now get into relationships not primarily for status security or children but in order to be happy an enormous challenge for which we need a little bit of help you have just entered the space of a couples therapist and you know there wasn't too long ago that there was very little couples therapy but couples therapy became really important once a very important shift took place which is that this is the first time that a survival of the family depends basically on the happiness of the couple that's why we do couples therapy to help people experience a different quality of connection between them we are literally making the play book as we go and instead of having rules what we have today is conversations everything is a freaking negotiation everything is negotiated who's gonna wake up to feed the baby and whose career actually matters and who's gonna plan for the next date and am i happy and am i happy enough and should I do this or should I do that should I date this person should I date only one person maybe a few what gender should they be you know it's an enormous amount of things I'm just you know you used to choose between two people in the village John and James that was it Mary and Rebecca you know that was that this this new thing here you know you know this is phenomenal I mean I have options like I've never had but how am I going to combine market economy commodification of people and romantic consumerism it's partly because our expectations are so high that we suffer so in love we feel entitled and when we are resentful and when we get upset in our relationships is because we are grappling with our sense of entitlement I was promised this thing you owe me this thing you told me that you would make me happy that was the story of romantic love a lot of our unhappiness in love has come to focus on sex duty was the organizing principle of sexuality in committed relationship not desire but we made an enormous change around that you know primarily due to the demo thanks to the democratization of contraception we could shift duty to desire we could for the first time separate sex from reproduction everybody talks about communication but we have to talk about things that we've never had to talk about and it's often difficult to talk about them with the person that we are closest to I don't have to tell you surprisingly that many people find it much easier to talk about sex with anybody but the person they're having sex with part of what kills relationships according to parole is the feeling that you own your partner desire is also rooted in absence and in longing the essential question of desire is can we want what we already have and I think the couples who have an erotic spark a copper's who never live under the illusion that they have each other they don't think their partner belongs to them and they think their partner is at best on loan with an option to renew that's they can tolerate that truth because you can always lose your partner but you can create mechanisms to deny the truth because it's really anxiety-producing but that moment of anxiety that little bit of anxiety is actually where desire resides because it makes you keep wanting because you don't really feel that you have we asked pearl why people have a fan's what really interested me is the fact that actually Affairs do happen in good relationships too in satisfying relationships that is much more interesting why do people still do and the majority of people that therapists anyway work with I am NOT chronic philanderers they are often people who have been faithful for decades and then when they cross the line that they themselves never thought they would cross so then you ask for a glimmer of what why would people risk losing everything they have built for what and that's when this thing about desire and the power of the erotic becomes so powerful and the best way I understood it that one word all over the world that people kept telling me when they would interview those who had affairs I feel alive and what it meant was that there was a sense of deadness that had crept up inside of them not the responsibility of the other person not even the responsibility of marriage just and often in a way that they had allowed themselves to disappear and they began to say to me this very unusual sentence it's not that I wanted to leave my partner it's what I wanted to leave who I had become Parral wants us to be open minded about the sort of relationship that might work for us what we need is emotional connection but that might mean all kinds of arrangements sexually do we want connection yes we want connection with there is something about us that doesn't live well alone and how these connections will manifest is up for you know for some of us it will take that model of the traditional relationship long term one person the whole thing and for others of it's going to be a serial monogamy and for others it's going to be the consensual non-monogamy or a polyamory the most important thing is that it there isn't a once it's all and at this point there is one model and if you don't succeed at it you divorce and divorce is not for the disillusion divorce is for the true idealists because they believe in the model just just think that they chose the wrong person and they'll do better next time by choosing a better person not by you know so check if the model works for you it's like innovation has entered every space except for marriage you know disrupt it a little bit does this say what we need above all is to expand the sort of conversations we're having around sex sex is not something you do it's a place you go and then you ask yourself where do you go in sex is it a place to be naughty is it a place to be to abdicate responsibility is it a place to be taken care of is it a place to be safely dominant is it a place to surrender is it a place for spiritual union is it a place to be aggressive and finally be able to just command your wishes but playfully playfully and ask yourselves what part of me connects with my sexuality where do I go in sex don't think act don't think performance and don't think the kind of narrow male focused genitally model of sex of four minutes of foreplay before the real thing and the real thing is intercourse and it ends with an orgasm and then when he's done it's done per

    "Title": "Should We Play It Cool When We Like Someone?",
    "Transcript": "One of the paradoxes of the dating game is that we know that by coming across as enthusiastic at an early stage If we bring them the next day if we're open about how attractive we find them if we suggest meeting them again very soon we are putting ourselves at a high risk of disgusting the very person we would so like to build a relationship with It is in order to counter this risk that early on in our dating lives we are taught by well-meaning friends to adopt a facade of cruel and indifference we become experts are deliberately not phoning or sending messages are treating our dates in a Carefully offhand manner and in subtly pretending we don't much care if we never cross their paths again we are told that the only way to get them to care about us is to pretend not to care for them and in the process We waste a lot of time We may lose them altogether and we have to suffer the indignity of denying that we feel a desire that should never have been associated with shame in the first place But we can find a way out of the conundrum by drilling deeper into the philosophy That underpins the well flagged danger of being overly eager Why is detachment so often recommended? Why are we not meant to call too soon? High levels of enthusiasm are generally not recommended for one central reason because they have been equated with what is a true Psychological problem manic dependence in other words calling too soon has become a symbol of weakness Desperation and the inability to deal adequately with life's challenges without the constant support of a lover whose real identity the manically keen party doesn't much care about Because their underlying priority is to ensure that they're never alone without someone Rather than with any one being in particular But we should note that what is ultimately the problem is manic dependence not high enthusiasm The difficulty is that our cultural narratives have unfairly glued These two elements together with an unnecessarily strong a none budging kind of adhesive yet There should logically be an option to disentangle the two strands that is to be able to reveal high enthusiasm And at the same time not thereby to imply manic dependence there should be an option to appear at once very keen and very sane The ability to do so depends on a little-known emotional art to which we seldom have recourse or introduction We call it strong Vulnerability the strongly vulnerable person is a diplomat of the emotions who manages carefully to unite on the one hand self-confidence and independence and on the other a capacity for closeness self revelation and honesty It is a balancing act the strongly vulnerable know how to confess with authority to a sense of feeling small They can sound in control even while revealing that they have an impression of being lost They can talk as adults about their childlike dimensions they can be unfrightening at the same time as admitting to their own fears and they can tell us of their immense desire for us while simultaneously Leaving us under the impression that they could fully survive a frank rejection. They would love to build a life with us They imply but they could very quickly and adroitly find something else to do if that didn't sound much like fun from our side In the way that the strongly vulnerable speak of their desire for us. We sense a beguiling mixture of candor and Independence, they don't need to play it cool because they carry off high enthusiasm in a way which sidesteps the dangers That playing cool has traditionally and nefariously been associated with what is off-putting Is never in fact that someone likes us What is frightening is that they seem in danger of having no options other than us of not being able to survive without us manic dependence not Enthusiasm is only ever the problem with this distinction in mind. We should to tell those we like that we're really extremely keen to see them again perhaps as early as tomorrow night and find them exceptionally marvelous while simultaneously Leaving them in no doubt that we could if the answer were no without trouble and at high speed find some equally enchanting people to play with and be bewitched by If you enjoyed our film, please subscribe to our channel and click the bell icon to turn on notifications To learn more about love try our book on how to find love Which explains why we have the types we do and how our early experiences shape how and whom we love"

    "Title": "How to Cope When You've Been Left",
    "Transcript": "Sometimes, we are not only left in love; we are left for someone else – a rival who comes to assume a large, indeed monstrous position in our imaginations. The torture comes down to one essential question which pursues us into the early hours: What do they have that we do not? Part of the agony rests on a basic feature of human psychology; we know ourselves from the inside, in great and dispiriting detail, whereas we can know others only from the outside, from what they choose to reveal, which may be almost nothing, aside from an attractive face and a charming manner. As a result, we may feel that the person we have been left for – and whom we know only on the basis of having briefly met them at a party or stalked their online profile – is wonderful in every way. Where we are shy, they will be confident; where we are chaotic they will be well-organised; where our sexuality is complex, theirs will be simple; where we're too domestic, they will be exciting… Well-meaning friends may try to bring us back into contact with our good sides: they will speak of our kindness, intelligence or sense of fun. But this may not be the best way forward; the point isn't to rehearse how decent we are. Properly to get over the pain of a love-rival, we need to realise how mediocre pretty much every human who has ever existed tends to be. There is not, in fact, ever any such thing as a 'perfect person', there are merely differently tricky ones, as time will inevitably reveal to our idealising ex. Our failings or defects may well be real but the picture we've got of ourselves as compared with our love rival is skewed by undue ignorance. Recovery does not involve the denial of our less admirable sides: it requires a more nihilistic, and therefore more balanced sense of what people in general are like. Of course the rival has qualities we lack. It is true that they have better hair, or a more impressive salary. But at the same time they have an enormous number of very serious problems which we can be assured exist, not because we know them, but because we know human beings in general. No one examined from up close is ever anything other than disappointing – and every person one has to share a life with will prove so maddening over time, one will at points wish they had never been born. Whatever attraction a new lover can offer our ex, they will also supply them with a whole a new set of irritants, which will end up frustrating them as much we ever did, indeed more so, because they so sincerely hoped – as they packed their bags – that such flaws would not exist in their next partner. Our ex-lover has not entered the gates of paradise, they have merely exchanged one imperfect relationship for another. We should never compound our grief with the thought that our ex will be uncomplicatedly happy. The deep lesson of being supplanted is not that we are so bad. It's that we have been left because of a common delusion: the belief that if only one was in a different relationship, one would be substantially happier. And yet, the truth is that more or less every human relationship has its own special and beautifully distinct forms of acute unhappiness. That there is much wrong with us is, of course, true; but this dark fact invariably sits within a far larger, grimmer and yet strangely consoling truth: that every person has much wrong with them. In future relationships, once we get over abandonment, the person we need to find is not the one who thinks we are perfect (and will never leave us on this basis) but rather one who can quite clearly see our failings and yet – the key advantage – knows how calmly to make their peace with them. The lover we need is not someone who stays with us because they think we are irreplaceably marvellous but because they've wisely realised that no-one is as attractive as they seem at first – and that to smash up a relationship generally involves nothing much finer than a prelude to novel encounters with frustration and disappointment. Our perspective cards feature tools for a wiser, calmer perspective on life.  They help to restor calm and clarity even during difficult times.

    "Title": "Why Avoidant and Anxious Partners Find It Hard to Split Up",
    "Transcript": "There is a certain sort of relationship that is alternately passionate, fiery and painfully unfulfilling – and that tends to puzzle both outsiders and its participants; a relationship between one person who is, as psychologists put it, anxiously attached and another who is avoidantly attached. There is, in such couplings, a constant game of push and pull. The anxiously attached party typically complains – more or less loudly – that their partner is not responsive enough: they accuse them of being emotionally distant, withholding, cold and perhaps physically uninterested too. The avoidant lover, for their part, stays relatively quiet but in their more fed-up moments, complains that the anxious party is far too demanding, possibly 'mad' and, as they put it pejoratively, 'needy'. One person seems to want far too much, the other far too little. Image result for william eggleston The unhappiness unfolds in a cycle. At the start, the anxious partner loves the avoidant one with great intensity – but, in time, also growing frustration. The dissatisfaction grows ever more intense until, eventually one day, fed up with so much seeming rejection, the anxious partner overcomes their fears, decides they need something better and tells their lover that they're off. At which point, the avoidant party undergoes a complete seachange. Their greatest fear, that of being engulfed in love, disappears at a stroke and reveals something that is normally utterly submerged in their character: a fear of being abandoned. Wholly liberated from the threat of being engulfed (the anxious one may by now have packed their bags), the avoidant one gives free reign to all their reserves of pent up romanticism and ardour – which feel utterly safe to bring out, now that there seems so little danger of reciprocation. Despite their fury, the anxious person hears the honeyed words and forthright promises, and – after some initial doubts – can't help but be won over. The formerly distant partner appears to have become, in the nick of time, as they'd always wanted them to be, a warm soul. There is no reason not to return: after all, it's not that they didn't love this person, it was the feeling they weren't loved back that was making things impossible…  For a time, there is bliss – and it seems that the couple are headed for long-term happiness. Liberated from their anxiety around engulfment, the avoidant partner gives free expression to love; liberated from their fear of abandonment, the anxious one is left feeling secure and trusting. But soon enough the problems return. Things become, as it were, too nice for the avoidant partner. It seems the anxious one isn't going to leave them any more, they're just going to stick around and seek ever greater closeness – and so the old fear of engulfment returns. They have no option but to start to pull away again and get distant, which gradually proves intolerable once again to the anxious partner. Within weeks or months, the pair are back in the same situation. Fierce arguments are back: the words needy and cold are once more in circulation. It's time for another crisis and another threat of departure. It may go on like this for years, or a lifetime… From the outside, it is almost funny. From the inside, it is hellish. There are a few ways out: the avoidant party can realise, and learn to tolerate their fear of engulfment. The anxious party can grow conscious of their unnatural pull towards unfulfilling people, refuse to go back after a crisis and seek a future with more secure and reassuring sorts. Or, yet more hopefully, both partners can acquire the vocabulary of attachment theory, come to observe their repetitions, gain some insight into aspects of their childhoods that drive them on – and learn not to act out their compulsions. They can learn the games they are unconsciously playing – and then, to the relief of all who care for them and to the redemption of their relationship, refuse to play them any longer.

    "Title": "What Is Your Attachment Style?",
    "Transcript": "One of the greatest questionnaires in the history of 20th-century psychology had a modest start in the pages of a local Colorado newspaper The Rocky Mountain News in July 1985. The work of two University of Denver psychologists Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver, the questionnaire asked readers to identify which of three statements most closely reflected who they were in love. Image result for rocky mountains To hugely improve our chances of thriving in relationships, we should dare to take the same test: A: I find it relatively easy to get close to others and am comfortable depending on them and having them depend on me. I don't worry about being abandoned or about someone getting too close to me. B: I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I often worry that my partner doesn't really love me or won't want to stay with me. I want to get very close to my partner, and this sometimes scares people away. C: I am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others; I find it difficult to trust them completely, difficult to allow myself to depend on them. I am nervous when anyone gets too close, and often, others want me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable being. Behind the scenes, the options refer to the three main styles of relating to others first identified by the English psychologist John Bowlby, the inventor of Attachment Theory in the 1950s and 60s. Option A signals what is known as a secure pattern of attachment, whereby love and trust come easily. Option B is known as anxious attachment, where one longs to be intimate with others but is continuously scared of letdown and often precipitates crises in relationships through counter-productively aggressive behaviour. And Option C refers to the avoidant pattern of attachment, where it feels much easier to avoid the dangers of intimacy through solitary activities and emotional withdrawal. Questionnaires in newspapers are rarely of much use but Hazan's and Shaver's is the momentous exception. If there is one thing we should do to improve our relationships, it is to know which of the three categories we predominantly belong to – and to deploy the knowledge in love so as to warn ourselves and others of the traps we might fall into. We then need a little training because half of us at least are not secure in love; we belong in the camps of either the avoidant or the anxious, and we have – to complicate matters – an above average propensity to fall in love with someone from the other damaged side, thereby aggravating our insecurities and defences in the process. Niccolo Pisano An Idyll: Daphnis and Chloe Here is a brief list of what avoidants and anxious types should keep in mind in their relationships: IF YOU ARE AN AVOIDANT WITH SOMEONE ANXIOUSLY ATTACHED Recognise the extent to which you check out emotionally when things are intense, particularly when there is an offer of closeness. Recognise how you will tend to prefer sex and closeness with strangers and how nervous you will be around cuddles and kissing. You probably don't want the light on either. Watch how you sabotage long-term intimacy. Have compassion that you are afraid of what you really want. Think back to how in your past, closeness would have been frightening because people let you down, and observe how you adopted a strategy of removal to protect yourself. You are hurt, not bad. Remind yourself that the present is different from the past and that you are ruining the present by bringing to it fear-laden dynamics that don't belong there. It may feel like your partner is being aggressive and ill-tempered with you for no reason; they are at heart upset and unable to express their needs in any other way. They want you; and that is why they are behaving as they are. Look beneath their nagging and their accusations and believe in their underlying goodwill. When they attack you, see their longing for love. Do that very frightening thing: extend reassurance. And explain, calmly, the appeal of the cave. IF YOU ARE AN ANXIOUS PERSON WITH AN AVOIDANT PARTNER Things are not necessarily as bad as they seem. Their quiet might just be quiet, not a lack of love. Their distance isn't meanness, it's their way of maintaining equilibrium. You are not demented or 'needy' to want more; but your way of dealing with what you legitimately need is aggravating things hugely. You are triggering your partner by asking for intimacy too directly and also (probably) with too much anger. Realise that you need to tread lightly, and to be a little distant in requesting closeness. The partner isn't mean or freakish; merely damaged – as are you. And that's very normal. A full 40% of the population are in your positions. Knowing whether we can be classed as secure, avoidant or anxious in love should be a basic fact we grasp about ourselves. The next step is to accept with grace that if we are either avoidant or anxious, we will need considerable emotional schooling to get out of scratchy patterns and stand a chance of building up a good enough relationship.

    "Title": "What True Love Really Is",
    "Transcript": "The world is sick for a surprisingly modest-sounding reason: we don't understand love – and yet we are rather convinced that we do. We talk a lot of love of course, but generally in terms of a dizzying rapture lasting a few months focused on someone's beauty, intelligence and strength. The most convincing discussion of love in the West came from Jesus of Nazareth, which has been unfortunate, given how easy it is to overlook everything he had to say once you don't 'believe'. We might require a new philosophy of love, in effect, a powerful secular religion of love. Here would be seven possible ingredients in Love redefined: CHARITY Love means, above anything else, benevolence and gentleness towards what is failed, disgraced, broken, unappealing, angry and foul in other people and in ourselves. Love isn't about an admiration for strength, it's about directing sympathy in a most unexpected direction: at what is messed up, lost and in pieces, and at what we might hate, resent and be frightened of. Anyone can express an interest in perfection, to love is to devote an active charity towards the mistakes and aberrations. One day, we will all require the charity of others. In one way or another, we'll be on our knees – and we will need people to look past our evident failings in a tender search for our deeply hidden merits. IMAGINATION To love with imagination is to look beneath the surface – where there may be rage, cynicism, brittleness or transgression – and to picture the suffering and pain that got a person to this place. To love with imagination is to fill in the better reasons why others are behaving as they do. Imaginative love knows that we are all, somewhere, desperate: it seeks out that desperation and treats it with sorrowful gentleness. KINDNESS There are so many fighters for social justice, so many people determined to make a better world. They denounce their enemies, and feel certain of their cause, but along the way, they have a fateful habit of forgetting to be kind. In their denunciations of the evils of others, there is precious little mercy, humility, tenderness or grace. It is not enough to be right or just, to be kind is to know that everyone, even sinners, and in a way, especially sinners, deserve ongoing sympathy and mercy. It is never simply because someone is wrong that we have any right to cease showing them the greatest kindness. FORGIVENESS To forgive is to know that we are, in our own way, as guilty as the next person. Given what we all are, we have no option but to cut each other slack. Of course we have failed and been hasty and less than admirable. But that is no reason forever to withhold love. We learn to forgive when we are no longer self-righteous, that is, when we're brave enough to fathom the darker sections of our own hearts. LOYALTY To love means being loyal to people (this could be ourselves) even though the crowd no longer agrees. Outside the mob may be jeering, but we continue on the same side, with steadfastness and an unbudgeable resilient faith. GENEROSITY Love overflows. It isn't about loving just one person, it encompasses the love of someone you have just met, of strangers in another land, of the earth, of plants, weevils, house bats and a moth by the window who might be dead by nightfall. PATIENCE We want others to meet our hopes right now. But true love means giving people the time to mature and develop; to go wrong, to wander in another direction, and not to shout at them but to give them every chance to grow, at their own pace, towards their better selves. If we can believe wholeheartedly in some of the above, it won't matter who we vote for or what our cause is, we can count as part of what is helping. We should be almost done with Romantic love by now. We should be setting our sights on the challenge of this sort of love. Yet it's not surprising if we're still only at the beginning, we're just starting on the path to being human. Love is a skill that we can learn.  Our Relationships book calmly guides us with calm and charm through the key issues of relationships to ensure that success in love need not be a matter of good luck.  for more click the link now."

    "Transcript": "When we imagine where in the world we'd be happiest, we're often prompted to imagine places filled with people; a cosy home with family, a party with friends, a busy office or bar, well-lit streets teaming with cheerful faces… But defining happy places in these terms misses out what can be the deep appeal of far less publicised and distinguished sorts of environment: locations that are starkly downbeat, empty, melancholic, architecturally compromised and isolated – but where we nevertheless experience a deep pull, coming to feel, perhaps, that we belong here far more than in the gaiety, elegance and colour of familiar vistas. We may have an instinctive sense that we are true natives of the isolated motorway diner at 11pm. Or of the open road, under a boundless sky in which a billion stars are starting to appear. Or of dusk at the container port – or of night under the shadow of vast electricity pylons marching across the landscape to an unknown city whose eerie orange aura glows over the hills. In these lonely, isolated places, we have an opportunity to meet with bits of ourselves with which the routines of daily life don't allow us to commune. We are keeping an appointment with a disavowed side of our characters, and can have internal conversations of a sort that are drowned out by the normal chatter, the smiling and the casual enquiries of our regular lives. We are recovering a sense of who we are, turning over memories and plans, regrets and excitements – without any pressure to be reassuring, purposeful or just (so-called) normal. The bleakness all around is a relief from the false comforts of home. We don't have to pretend any longer. The environment supports us in our wish to own up to a sadness we have had to hide from for too long. The fellow outsiders we encounter in these lonely places seem closer to offering us the true community we crave than the friends we should supposedly rely on. In their sad faces and grief-stricken eyes, we recognise the most sincere, bruised bits of ourselves. They seem like our true brothers and sisters – also unable to accommodate their characters within the strictures of the ordinary world, outcasts and – in their own way – visionaries. There can be something almost beautiful about the ugliest kinds of lonely places: plastified, brightly lit, garish, cheap. The lack of domesticity, the pitiless illumination and anonymous furniture offer an alternative to ordinary sentimentality and good taste. It may be easier to give way to sadness here than in a cosy living room with wallpaper and framed photos. If we are defined by the places where we feel 'at home', some of these may have nothing at all to do with homeliness as we presently conceive of the term; and yet they may comprise our truest and best homes nevertheless. Our wisdom display cards explore what it really means to be wise and how we can strive to become more enlightened in our everyday lives."

    "Title": "In Praise of Unrequited Love",
    "Transcript": "We are a practical species, and when we think of love, it is normal to focus on the sort that goes places, that is mutual, that leads people to form couples and perhaps one day households. But the more peculiar reality is that the greatest share of humanity's love stories have unfolded in a directionless form in the recesses of the mind of only one party. It seems that we are – in aggregate at least – committed first and foremost to the unrequited version of love. At any point, millions of love stories are quietly being spun by one person while the object of their adoration goes about their business blithely unconcerned. Someone watches someone else on a train, casts surreptitious glances at a delegate at a conference; carefully notes a fellow shopper's manner in a grocery store – and the earth spins on undisturbed. Unrequited lovers are easy to dismiss as not far from pathetic. If we were better designed and a little saner, we would of course never develop feelings for people who were not prepared to develop them for us – nor squander our days on desires without logical or practical outcome. Related image But, looked at more benevolently, there is something hugely salutary and noble about our capacity to entertain tender daydreams. It is a feat to be able to detonate powerful longings without causing any inconvenience to other people. The ability to daydream is a significant human achievement. Rather than wishing that we stop doing so, we should be worried by what might happen to us if we couldn't daydream, if we were faced with the choice of either accepting reality in all its barrenness or else of barging into the lives of others with unwanted desires. Daydreaming is a vital and artful safety valve, mediating between resignation on the one hand and uncontained effusions on the other. Along the way, unrequited love provides us with an occasion to exercise our aptitudes for optimism in a highly salutary way. After a few decades on the earth, it is only too easy to start to hate our fellow humans for their mediocrity, selfishness and idiocy. But with our beloved in mind, we can, for once, give free reign to a boundless generosity that a god or the parent of a newborn might deploy. We can tell ourselves that we have found an angel, an exalted being, on the basis of nothing more than how wise their green eyes look or how delicately they open their yogurt for lunch. Our verdicts are a delusional exaggeration, but – given how much grounds there is to despair at the human experiment – perhaps a noble and forgivable one as well. Related image It's the privilege of unrequited love never to have to encounter the disappointment that follows from contact with reality. We are not after accurate knowledge of what it would be like to coexist with this person. We don't really want to know how they might behave in the midst of a crisis at work or over a holiday with their parents. We've been through enough such trials – and the results aren't edifying. Of course they would, after a time in our arms, prove less than ideal and a little more like everyone else we know. We may be denied intimacy, but we are granted access to something arguably far nicer: boundless hope. We can attach to the form and figure of the person we desire everything we so want to be true about human beings. The beloved becomes the repository of every desire: for a particular kind of intelligence, wit, temperament and outlook. The older we get, the more unrequited love brings us back into contact with a passion and hope that feels like an essential relief, like finding out that we can still run – or giggle. In meditating on our beloved, we're not getting to know a real person; we are gaining an insight into our ideals. One day, perhaps in the not too distant future, we'll be surrounded by a thought police that will look inside our minds at will and ruthlessly condemn for us for all the phantasmagoria that goes on in them. But for the moment at least, we can have any thought we like with impunity: we and the beloved can go on holiday to Portugal, can have four adorable children together, can dance in the town square all night – and the armed guards will never know. Image result for le rayon vert It is hard to share with most acquaintances quite what we are going through. But those who do understand become the targets of particular gratitude. A true friend will indulge our folly and be generous to our melodramas. They will avoid the easy task of censoring and upbraiding us. They will have enough of an impression of our basic mental health to shepherd us only gently back to melancholic sanity. Episodes of unrequited love force us to develop a sense of humour about ourselves. It is impossible to think too well of who we are in their aftermath. Unrequited love edges us inevitably towards a basic humility. We are at last confirmed as truly ridiculous. With any luck, no one gets hurt, it is just that, for a time, the world seems a bit more wondrous, more exciting and more blessed than usual. A natural impulse is to try to convert our longings into something more sensible, either to start a proper love affair or else to dismiss our dreams as too silly to nurture. Maybe we should do neither, but rather let the unrequited love exist on its own, neither fully grown up nor wholly damnable, neither deeply horrible nor quite sane. It is just the mind, a very complicated machine, constrained by the narrowness of existence, turning its wheels, tantalised by a vision of happiness and sensing, quite rightly and quite hopelessly, that there could have been so much more to life than there ever will be.

    "Title": "How to Soothe Ourselves and Others",
    "Transcript": "It's the middle of the night, let's imagine, and we've been on the earth for about three months. A lot is still very unclear. We are profoundly helpless, barely able to move our own head and utterly at the mercy of others. The sources of our suffering and joy lie far outside our understanding. Hugely powerful needs pass through us at regular intervals and we have no way of making sense of them to ourselves – let alone of communicating them reliably to others. A minute ago, we were asleep in a dark enveloping warmth. Now we're awake, bereft, isolated and very uncomfortable. There seems to be a pain somewhere in our stomach, but the agony is more general; we are lonely and profoundly sad. The room is dark and there's a mysterious set of shadows on the wall that appear and vanish at random. In a rising panic, we start to scream out in the darkness. Nothing happens. We pause to recover our breath – and then scream even louder. Our lungs strain with the effort. Still nothing and the darkness and loneliness grow ever more threatening. Now true desperation sets in; this feels like the end of everything good and true – and we scream as if to ward off death. At last, just when it seems we could not go on any further, the door opens. A warm orange light is turned on. It is a familiar face. They smile at us, say the name they often use around us, pick us up and put us against their shoulder. We can hear a familiar heart beating next to ours and a warm hand caressing the top of our head. They gently move us to and fro, and sing a tender, sweet song. Our sobs start to abate, we pull a weak smile; it feels like the vicious demons and merciless goblins have been sent packing – and that life could be bearable after all. Image result for mother and child painting Soothing is one of the kindest gestures that humans ever perform for one another. It must lie close to the core of love – and is what can make the difference between a desire to die and the capacity to endure. Awkwardly, it tends to be very hard to soothe ourselves unless we have first – usually in childhood – been properly soothed by someone else. A capacity for self-soothing is the legacy of a history of nurture. If we have been picked up enough times early on, and sufficiently reassured in the midst of panic that we will make it, then one part of the mind learns the art and can practice it on the other – and eventually, on people outside us too. At moments of crisis, we find ourselves able to access a voice that calms the waves of fear and the blows of self-hatred: we can sort this out; we'll have a conversation with them; people understand; screw them if they don't; what matters is you; you are good and valuable. We have available an unflustered, resolute response as much to the most awful events as to routine panics. We have a faith that we can endure, that something will show up and that we don't deserve the worst. Reflecting on the art of soothing may bring into focus just how much we are missing. We are not mysteriously deficient, we were brought up by adults who were themselves not soothed. We need to grow attentive and deeply sympathetic to the missing pieces of our psyche. It is because we didn't benefit from soothing that life is so much harder than it should be; that nowadays rejection is so bitter, social media is so frightening, disapproval feels so fatal, ambiguity is so unbearable, sleep feels so unearnt, holidays are so worrying, the caresses of others feel so alien – and so many of our days and nights are rocked by what feel like near-death experiences. Image result for mother and child painting There are – one must believe – substitutes and opportunities for catching up. We can have recourse to music, diaries, beds, baths but, most importantly, other people. However, seeking out the sort of people who can soothe us may be the hardest step. We may mistake a capacity to soothe for weakness or naivety. We may take the soother for a fool. We may need soothing so much, we find ourselves unable to ask for it nicely, shouting counter-productively instead – or else we withdraw into defensive independence, because help feels like it hasn't come soon enough. Those in the greatest need of soothing often have no idea of what is missing, no sensible way of articulating their need – and a dogged suspicion of kindness were it to be offered to them. We should strive not to make things constantly scarier in our own minds than they are in reality. We should offer soothing continuously to others – and insist to the more sceptical and parched parts of our own minds that they too deserve one day to be the beneficiaries of kindness and reassurance.

    "Title": "How to Cope If the Worst Came to the Worst..",
    "Transcript": "In the background, many of us are terrified of so much – disgrace, illness, sacking, our mortality, the suffering and death of loved ones… When these fears come up, we are often encouraged, out of kindness, to think of the best-case scenarios. It's a well-meaning move, but it also – unintentionally – leaves our fears to fester; they fill us with unnamed dread and sometimes loom far larger than they should. So an opposite move – displayed here – involves looking our anxieties directly in the eye, refusing to be cowed by them and examining them in exhaustive detail so as to drain them of their debilitating power. Doing so is liable to bring us to an important realisation: we could cope – even if the worst came to the worst… What follows are some invitations to meditate on scary things, not in order to depress us, but to lend us a buoyant, optimistic sense of our resilience and adaptability. If the worst came to the worst… …I would learn I had far fewer friends – but the ones that remained would be the true ones; the ones who could see past my (ruined) social status to the genuine me beneath. If the worst came to the worst… it would no longer be an option to follow the safe, respectable, prestigious path. With far less left to lose, I would at last be granted the opportunity to explore the riskier, yet more fulfilling occupations I had always somewhere hankered for but been too socially-anxious to try. If the worst came to the worst… …I would learn to measure my self-worth by my own standards rather than the whims and applause of the crowd. I would grow a sense of self independent of the verdicts of others. If the worst came to the worst… …I would look with new admiration and humility at the unhurried calm, natural stoicism and resilience of animals. If the worst came to the worst…I would learn to contemplate my sorrows from the vantage point of a distant nebula and would recognise my life as the petty and insignificant thing it truly is and always was. If the worst came to the worst… …I would develop appropriate gratitude for every apparently minor thing – and every day that unfolded without further catastrophe would be recognised as the blessing it truly is. If the worst came to the worst …I would understand that life was not something that could ever be moulded into a wholly flawless and error-free entity – but is an always imperfect, necessarily wonky cobbled-together construction, full of marks and blemishes – which nevertheless possess their own beauty and dignity. If the worst came to the worst …I would learn to distinguish between what is really serious and worth lamenting and what is only ever a passing nuisance. I would, in so many situations, be infinitely calmer. If the worst came to the worst …my failure would embolden others to share stories of their own sadness, confusion and humilliation and we would, together, face up to the suffering we so often, currently, unfairly, endure alone. If the worst came to the worst… I would see that the struggle for fame, money and success was only ever a doomed attempt to compensate for an unconditional love that was longed for but denied in childhood. Worldly craving would give way to melancholy and mourning. to the worst … I'd cease to be so scared of looking within – and might, perhaps, one day give psychotherapy a go. If the worst came to the worst …I would play the saddest songs that have been waiting, in the wings, for me all this time. If the worst came to the worst …truly the worst, then all the rage, grief, anxiety and fear would be at an end – and we would, at last, as the prayers so beautifully put it, be at peace.

    "Title": "Love Me for Who I Really Am",
    "Transcript": "Our culture strongly inclines us to the view that genuine love must involve complete acceptance of another person in their good and especially in their somewhat bad sides. In moments of fury with our partners, we may be tempted to dismiss their complaints against us, with the cry: \"Just love me as I am!\" but in truth none of us should want to remain exactly as we are in love and therefore none of us should, too strongly, want another person to love as opposed to tolerate or simply forgive what is warped within us. Genuine love might be defined as gently and kindly helping someone to become the best version of themselves, not accepting themselves precisely as they are. It isn't a betrayal of love for someone to try to help us to evolve, to teach us, to become better people. In fact, it may be the highest proof of genuine commitment. Unfortunately, under the sway of a romantic ideology that makes us suspicious of emotional education, most of us end up being terrible teachers and equally terrible students in relationships. We don't accept the legitimacy, let alone the nobility of others desire to teach us and we can't acknowledge areas, where we might need to be taught. We rebel against the very structure of a lover's education that would enable criticism to be molded into sensible sounding lessons and to be heard as caring attempts to reject the more troublesome aspects of our personalities. At the first sign that the other person is adopting a \"teacherly\" tone, we tend to assume that we're being attacked and betrayed and therefore we close our ears to the instruction reacting with sarcasm and aggression to the teacher. Our stance is deeply understandable. To the mother everything about her tiny infant is delightful. They wouldn't change even the smallest thing; their baby is perfect just as it is. Our idea of love has taken this kind of attitude very much to heart. It's what we grow up thinking that love is supposed to be like. The suggestion that another person could want us to change grow or improve is taken as an insult to love. The problem is, the mother never in fact loved us just as we were. She hoped we would keep growing up. And the need to keep growing up is still there. Our bodies may be fully formed but our psyches always have some growing up still to do. We should never hold it against our lovers if they don't love us just as we are. They're doing something far more generous— wanting us to be a little better. If you want to learn more about love, try our book on how to find love, which explains why we have the types we do, and how our early experiences give us scripts of how, and whom we love."

    "Title": "How the Modern World Makes Us Mentally Ill",
    "Transcript": "The modern world is wonderful in many ways (dentistry is good, cars are reliable, we can so easily keep in touch from Mexico with our grandmother in Scotland) – but it's also powerfully and tragically geared to causing a high background level of anxiety and widespread low-level depression. There are six particular features of modernity that have this psychologically disturbing effect. Each one has a potential cure, which we will only collectively put into action when we know more about the disease in question. Here are the six: 1. Meritocracy: Our societies tell us that everyone is free to make it if they have the talent and energy. The down side of this ostensibly liberating and beautiful idea is that any perceived lack of success is taken to be not, as in the past, an accident or misfortune, but a sure sign of a lack of talent or laziness. If those at the top deserve all their success, then those at the bottom must surely deserve all their failure. A society that thinks of itself as meritocratic turns poverty from a problem to evidence of damnation and those who have failed from unfortunates to losers. The cure is a strong, culturally endorsed belief in two big ideas: luck, which says success doesn't just depend on talent and effort; and tragedy, which says good, decent people can fail and deserve compassion, rather than contempt. 2. Individualism: An individualistic society preaches that the individual and their achievements are everything and that everyone is capable of a special destiny. It is not the community that matters; the group is for no-hopers. To be 'ordinary' is regarded as a curse. The result is that the very thing that most of us will end up being, statistically speaking, is associated, with freakish failure. The cure is a cult of the good ordinary life – and proper appreciation of the pleasures and quiet heroism of the everyday. 3. Secularism: Secular societies cease to believe in anything that is bigger than or beyond themselves. Religions used to perform the useful service of keeping our petty ways and status battles in perspective. But now there is nothing to awe or relativise humans, whose triumphs and mishaps end up feeling like the be all and end all. A cure would involve regularly using sources of transcendence to generate a benign, relativising perspective on our personal sorrows: music, the stars at night, the vast spaces of the desert or the ocean would humble us all in consoling ways. 4. Romanticism: The philosophy of Romanticism tells us that each of us has one very special person out there who can make us completely happy. Yet mostly we have to settle for moderately bearable relationships with someone who is very nice in a few ways and pretty difficult in many others. It feels like a disaster – in comparison with our original huge hopes. The cure is to realise that we didn't go wrong: we were just encouraged to believe in a very improbable dream. Instead we should build up our ambitions around friendship and non-sexual love. 5. The Media: The media has immense prestige and a huge place in our lives – but routinely directs our attention to things that scare, worry, panic and enrage us, while denying us agency or any chance for effective personal action. It typically attends to the least admirable sides of human nature, without a balancing exposure to normal good intentions, responsibility and decency. At its worst, it edges us towards mob justice. The cure would be news that concentrated on presenting solutions rather than generating outrage, that was alive to systemic problems rather than gleefully emphasizing scapegoats and emblematic monsters – and that would regularly remind us that the news we most need to focus on comes from our own lives and direct experiences. 6. Perfectibility: Modern societies stress that it is within our remit to be profoundly content, sane and accomplished. As a result, we end up loathing ourselves, feeling weak and sensing we've wasted our lives. A cure would be a culture that endlessly promotes the idea that perfection is not within our grasp – that being mentally slightly (and at points very) unwell is an inescapable part of the human condition and that what we need above all are good friends with whom we can sit and honestly discuss our real fears and vulnerabilities. The forces of psychological distress in our world are – currently – much wealthier and more active than the needed cures. We deserve tender pity for the price we have to pay for being born in modern times. But more hopefully, cures are now open to us individually and collectively if only we recognise, with sufficient clarity, the sources of our true anxieties and sorrows.

    "Title": "Criticism when you've had a bad childhood",
    "Transcript": "Criticism is never easy. To learn that others judge us to be foolish, perverse, ugly or unpleasant is one of the most challenging aspects of any life. However, the impact of criticism is hugely variable – and depends ultimately on a rather unexpected detail: what sort of childhood we have had. The clue to whether criticism will be experienced as merely unpleasant or wholly catastrophic lies in what happened to us many decades ago in the hands of our earliest caregivers. What is meant by a 'bad childhood' is here a matter, rather simply, of love. An infant arrives in the world with a very limited capacity to endure their own being. It is the tolerance, enthusiasm and forgiveness of another person that gradually acclimatises us to existence. Our caregivers' characteristic way of looking at us becomes the way we consider ourselves. It is by being loved by another that we acquire the art of looking sympathetically on our cracked and troublesome beings. It is simply not in our remit to believe in ourselves on our own. We are utterly reliant on an inner sense of having been valued inordinately by another person at the start as a protection against the subsequent neglect of the world. We don't need to be loved by many, one will do, and twelve years might be enough, sixteen ideally, but without it the eternal admiration of millions won't ever be able to convince us of our goodness. And with such a love, the scorn of millions won't ever need to be fatal. Bad childhoods have an unfortunate tendency to drive us to seek out situations in which there is a theoretical possibility of receiving outsized approval – which also means, along the way, a high risk of encountering outsized disapproval. The emotionally deprived return, almost manically to the question, never really settled of: 'Do I deserve to exist?' And this is why they typically put unusual effort into attempts to be famous and visibly successful. But of course the world at large will never give the emotionally nervous the unqualified confirmation they seek; there will always be dissenters and critics, people too bashed about by their own past to be able to be kind to others, and it is to these voices that those with bad childhoods will be attuned, however enthusiastic the crowd might be. We can observe, along the way, that the chief marker of being a good parent is that one's child simply has zero interest in being liked by large numbers of strangers. We do not all hear the same thing when we are criticised. Some of us, the lucky ones, hear just the surface message from the here and now: that our work fell short of expectations, that we must try harder with our assignments, that our book, film or song wasn't excellent. This can be bearable. But the more wounded among us hear far more. Criticism takes them straight back to the primordial injury. An attack now becomes entwined with the attacks of the past and grows enormous and unmanageable in its intensity. The boss or unfriendly colleague becomes the parent who let us down. Everything is pulled into question. Not only was the work subpar, we are a wretch, an undeserved being, a piece of excrement, the worst person in the world, for that is how it felt, back then, in the fragile, defenceless infant mind. Knowing more about our tricky childhoods provides us with a vital line of defence against the effects of criticism. It means that we can be on our guard, when we are attacked, against raising the stakes unnecessarily. We can learn to separate out the verdict of today from the emotional verdict we are carrying around with us and always seeking to confirm with the use of current events. We can learn that, however sad the attacks we are facing, they are as nothing next to the real tragedy and the effective cause of our sadness: that things went wrong back then. And so we can direct our attention to where it really belongs; away from today's critics and towards the unconvinced parent of yesteryear. We can forgive ourselves for being, in this area, through no fault of our own, fatefully sensitive – and, in essence, mentally unwell. We cannot stop the attacks of the world, but we can – through an exploration of our histories – change what they mean to us. We can also, importantly, get a second chance: we can go back and correct the original verdict of the world. We can take measures to expose ourselves to the gaze of friends or, more ideally, of a talented therapist who can hold up a more benign mirror and teach us a lesson that should have been gifted us from the start; that like every human, whatever our flaws, we deserve to be here. At The School of Life we believe that confidence is a skill we can learn. Our confidence prompt cards are designed to help us master this mysterious art.  Click now to learn more."

    "Title": "How to Stop Being a People Pleaser",
    "Transcript": "This video is sponsored by Skillshare, click the link in the description for more information. Being someone who pleases people sounds, on the face of it, like a very good idea. But it is a pattern of behaviour riddled with problems, as much for the perpetrator as for their audience; the people-pleaser is someone (who might at times be oneself) who feels they have no option but to mould themselves to the expectations of others, and yet, harbours all manner of secret and at points dangerous reservations and resentments. They act like the perfect lover when their real feelings are far darker; they give their assent to plans they hate; and they confuse everyone around them by failing to express, in due time, with the requisite courage, their authentic needs and ambitions. Putting it bluntly we could say that the people pleaser is a liar. It sounds brutal, but the people-pleaser is lying for poignant reasons: not in order to gain advantage, but because they are terrified of the displeasure of others. To understand – and potentially sympathise with – the people-pleaser we need to look at their past which almost invariably involves an early experience of being around people – usually a mother or a father – who seemed to be radically and terrifyingly incapable of accepting and forgiving certain necessary but perhaps tricky facts about their child. Perhaps our father flew into volcanic rage at any sign of disagreement. To present an opposing political idea, to suggest we wanted something different to eat, to be frank about our tiredness or anxiety, could threaten us with annihilation. To survive, we needed to be acutely responsive to what others expected us to do and say. The very question of what we might really want became secondary to an infinitely more important priority: manically second-guessing the desires of those on whom, at that time, our lives depended. We didn't always lie out of fear; it was also often out of love for someone we were profoundly attached to but who was vulnerable in some way. We lied out of a longing not to set off another marital row, a desire to keep a depressive parent in a good mood and to avoid adding a further burden to what seemed like an already very difficult or sad life. Who were we to make things even more complicated for a fragile person we cared for? However understandable the origins of our behaviour, in the more reflexive moments of adulthood, we might find three paths out from these difficult patterns of people-pleasing. The first relies on reminding ourselves that our colleagues, partners and friends are almost certainly very different from the people around whom our anxieties evolved in childhood. Most humans can cope quite well with a bit of contradiction, a dose of unwelcome information or an occasional rejection, delivered with requisite politeness. The other is not going to explode or dissolve. We learned a very particular habit of relating to the world around a group of people who were not representative of humanity as a whole. Secondly, we need to acknowledge the inadvertently harmful side-effects of our behaviour. We may genuinely have good intentions, but we are endangering everyone by not speaking more frankly. At work, we aren't doing anyone a service by withholding our doubts and reservations. And in love, there is no kindness in staying in a relationship simply because it seems the other might not survive without us. They will, but we will have wasted a lot of their time through our sentimentality. Finally, we can acquire the confidence to be artful about the difficult messages we have to impart. As a child we couldn't nuance the messages we wanted to send out. We didn't know how to craft our raw pain and needs into convincing explanations. Now, it is open to us to be firm in our own views – but extremely genial as well. We can say 'no' while indicating that we feel a lot of goodwill; we can say someone is wrong without implying that they are an idiot. We can leave someone, while ensuring they realise how much a relationship meant to us. We can – in other words – be pleasant without being people-pleasers.

    "Title": "The Importance of a Breakdown",
    "Transcript": "One of the great problems of human beings is that we're far too good at keeping going. We're experts at surrendering to the demands of the external world, living up to what is expected of us and getting on with the priorities as others around us define them. We keep showing up and being an excellent boy or girl – and we can pull this magical feat off for up to decades at a time, without so much as an outward twitch or crack. Until, suddenly, one day, much to everyone's surprise, including our own, we break. The rupture can take many forms. We can no longer get out bed. We fall into a catatonic depression. We develop all-consuming social anxiety. We refuse to eat. We babble incoherently. We lose command over part of our body. We are compelled to do something extremely scandalous and entirely contrary to our normal selves. We become wholly paranoid in a given area. We refuse to play by the usual rules in our relationship, we have an affair, ramp up the fighting – or otherwise poke a very large stick in the wheels of day-to-day life. Breakdowns are hugely inconvenient for everyone and so, unsurprisingly, there is an immediate rush to medicalise the problem and attempt to excise it from the scene, so that business as usual can restart. But this is to misunderstand what is going on when we break down. A breakdown is not merely a random piece of madness or malfunction, it is a very real – albeit very inarticulate – bid for health. It is an attempt by one part of our minds to force the other into a process of growth, self-understanding and self-development which it has hitherto refused to undertake. If we can put it paradoxically, it is an attempt to jumpstart a process of getting well, properly well, through a stage of falling very ill. The danger, therefore, if we merely medicalise a breakdown and attempt to shift it away at once is that we will miss the lesson embedded within our sickness. A breakdown isn't just a pain, though it is that too of course; it is an extraordinary opportunity to learn. The reason we break down is that we have not, over years, flexed very much. There were things we needed to hear inside our minds that we deftly put to one side, there were messages we needed to heed, bits of emotional learning and communicating we didn't do – and now, after being patient for so long, far too long, the emotional self is attempting to make itself heard in the only way it now knows how. It has become entirely desperate – and we should understand and even sympathise with its mute rage. What the breakdown is telling us above anything else is that it must no longer be business as usual – that things have to change or (and this can be properly frightening to witness) that death might be preferable. Why can't we simply listen to the emotional need calmly and in good time – and avoid the melodrama of a breakdown? Because the conscious mind is inherently lazy and squeamish and so reluctant to engage with what the breakdown eventually has to tell it with brutality. For years, it refuses to listen to a particular sadness; or there is a dysfunction in a relationship it is in flight from or there are desires it sweeps very far under the proverbial carpet. We can compare the process to a revolution. For years, the people press the government to listen to their demands and adjust. For years, the government makes token gestures but shuts its ears – until one day, it is simply too much for the people, who storm the palace gates, destroy the fine furnishings and shoot randomly at the innocent and the guilty. Mostly, in revolutions, there is no good outcome. The legitimate grievances and needs of the people are not addressed or even discovered. There is an ugly civil war – sometimes, literally, suicide. The same is true of breakdowns. Yet a good mental physician tries hard to listen to rather than censor the illness. They detect within its oddities a plea for more time for ourselves, for a closer relationship, for a more honest, fulfilled way of being, for acceptance for who we really are sexually…. That is why we started to drink, or to become reclusive or to grow entirely paranoid or manically seductive. A crisis represents an appetite for growth that hasn't found another way of expressing itself. Many people, after a horrific few months or years of breakdown, will say: 'I don't know how I'd ever have gotten well if I hadn't fallen ill'. In the midst of a breakdown, we often wonder whether we have gone mad. We have not. We're behaving oddly no doubt, but beneath the surface agitation, we are on a hidden yet logical search for health. We haven't become ill; we were ill already. Our crisis, if we can get through it, is an attempt to dislodge us from a toxic status quo and an insistent call to rebuild our lives on a more authentic and sincere basis.

    "Title": "The Need to be Alone",
    "Transcript": "Because our culture places such a high value on sociability, it can be deeply awkward to have to explain how much – at certain points – we need to be alone. We may try to pass off our desire as something work-related: people generally understand a need to finish off a project. But in truth, it's a far less respectable and more profound desire that is driving us on: unless we are alone, we are at risk of forgetting who we are. We, the ones who are asphyxiated without periods by ourselves, take other people very seriously – perhaps more seriously than those in the uncomplicated ranks of the endlessly gregarious. We listen closely to stories, we give ourselves to others, we respond with emotion and empathy. But as a result, we cannot keep swimming in company indefinitely. At a certain point, we have had enough of conversations that take us away from our own thought processes, enough of external demands that stop us heeding our inner tremors, enough of the pressure for superficial cheerfulness that denies the legitimacy of our latent inner melancholy – and enough of robust common-sense that flattens our peculiarities and less well-charted appetites. We need to be alone because life among other people unfolds too quickly. The pace is relentless: the jokes, the insights, the excitements. There can sometimes be enough in five minutes of social life to take up an hour of analysis. It is a quirk of our minds that not every emotion that impacts us is at once fully acknowledged, understood or even – as it were – truly felt. After time among others, there are a myriad of sensations that exist in an 'unprocessed' form within us. Perhaps an idea that someone raised made us anxious, prompting inchoate impulses for changes in our lives. Perhaps an anecdote sparked off an envious ambition that is worth decoding and listening to in order to grow. Maybe someone subtly fired an aggressive dart at us, and we haven't had the chance to realise we are hurt. We need some quiet time to console ourselves by formulating an explanation of where the nastiness might have come from. We are more vulnerable and tender-skinned than we're encouraged to imagine. By retreating into ourselves, it looks as if we are the enemies of others, but our solitary moments are in reality a homage to the richness of social existence. Unless we've had time alone, we can't be who we would like to be around our fellow humans. We won't have original opinions. We won't have lively and authentic perspectives. We'll be – in the wrong way – a bit like everyone else. We're drawn to solitude not because we despise humanity but because we are properly responsive to what the company of others entails. Extensive stretches of being alone may in reality be a precondition for knowing how to be a better friend and a properly attentive companion.

    "Title": "How A Messed Up Childhood Affects You In Adulthood",
    "Transcript": "We are, all of us, beautifully crazy or, to put it in gentler terms, fascinatingly unbalanced. Our childhoods, even the apparently benign ones, leave us no option but to be anything else. As a result of these childhoods, we tend, over most issues, to list – like a sailing yacht in high wind – far too much in one direction or another. We are too timid, or too assertive; too rigid or too accommodating; too focused on material success or excessively lackadaisical. We are obsessively eager around sex or painfully wary and nervous in the face of our own erotic impulses. We are dreamily naive or sourly down to earth; we recoil from risk or embrace it recklessly; we have emerged into adult life determined never to rely on anyone or as desperate for another to complete us; we are overly intellectual or unduly resistant to ideas. The encyclopedia of emotional imbalances is a volume without end. What is certain is that these imbalances come at a huge cost, rendering us less able to exploit our talents and opportunities, less able to lead satisfying lives and a great deal less fun to be around. Yet, because we are reluctant historians of our emotional pasts, we easily assume that these imbalances aren't things we could ever change; they are fundamentally innate. It's just how we were made. We simply are, in and of ourselves, people who micromanage or can't get much pleasure out of sex, scream a lot when someone contradicts us or run away from lovers who are too kind to us. It may not be easy, but nor is it alterable or up for enquiry. The truth is likely to be more hopeful – though, in the short term, more challenging. Our imbalances are invariably responses to something that happened in the past. We are a certain way because we were knocked off a more fulfilling trajectory years ago by a primal wound. In the face of a viciously competitive parent, we took refuge in underachievement. Having lived around a parent disgusted by the body, sex became frightening. Surrounded by material unreliability, we had to overachieve around money and social prestige. Hurt by a dismissive parent, we fell into patterns of emotional avoidance. A volatile parent pushed us towards our present meekness and inability to make a fuss. Early overprotectiveness inspired timidity and, around any complex situation, panic attacks. There is always a logic and there is always a history. We can tell that our imbalances date from the past because they reflect the way of thinking and instincts of the children we once were. Without anything pejorative being meant by this, our way of being unbalanced tends towards a fundamental immaturity, bearing the marks of what was once a young person's attempt to grapple with something utterly beyond their capacities. For example, when they suffer at the hands of an adult, children almost invariably take what happens to them as a reflection of something that must be very wrong with them. If someone humiliates, ignores or hurts them, it must – so it seems – be because they are, in and of themselves, imbecilic, repugnant and worth neglecting. It can take many years, and a lot of patient inner exploration, to reach an initially less plausible conclusion: that the hurt was essentially undeserved and that there were inevitably a lot of other things going on, off-stage, in the raging adult's interior life for which the child was entirely blameless. Similarly, because children cannot easily leave an offending situation, they are prey to powerful, limitless longings to fix, the broken person they so completely depend on. It becomes, in the infantile imagination, the child's responsibility to mend all the anger, addiction or sadness of the grown-up they adore. It may be the work of decades to develop an adult power to feel sad about, rather than eternally responsible for, those we cannot change. Communication patterns are beset by comparable childhood legacies. When something is very wrong, children have no innate capacity to explain their cause. They lack the confidence, poise and verbal dexterity to get their points across with the calm and authority required. They tend to dramatic overreactions instead, insisting, nagging, exploding, screaming. Or else excessive under-reactions: sulking, sullen silence, and avoidance. We may be well into middle-age before we can shed our first impulses to explode at or flee from those who misunderstand our needs and more carefully and serenely try to explain them instead. It's another feature of the emotional wounds of childhood that they tend to provoke what are in effect large-scale generalisations. Our wounds may have occurred in highly individual contexts: with one particular adult who hit their particular partner late at night in one particular terraced house in one town in the north. Or the wound may have been caused by one specific parent who responded with intense contempt after a specific job loss from one specific factory. But these events give rise to expectations of other people and life more broadly. We grow to expect that everyone will turn violent, that every partner may turn on us and every money problem will unleash disaster. The character traits and mentalities that were formed in response to one or two central actors of childhood become our habitual templates for interpreting pretty much anyone. For example, the always jokey and slightly manic way of being that we evolved so as to keep a depressed, listless mother engaged becomes our second nature. Even when she is long gone, we remain people who need to shine at every meeting, who require a partner to be continually focused on us and who cannot listen to negative or dispiriting information of any kind. We are living the wide open present through the narrow drama of the past. We suffer because we are, at huge cost, too loyal to the early difficult years. We should, where we can, dare to leave home.

    "Title": "Why We Worry All the Time and How to Cope",
    "Transcript": "It's not an illustrious category to belong to of course, but there are plenty of us at least. We worry about work, money, being left, illness, disappointing, over-promising, madness and disgrace, just to start the list. We worry in the early hours, we worry on holiday, we worry at parties and we worry all the time while we're trying to smile and seem normal to good people who depend on us. It can izeel pretty unbearable, at moments. A standard approach when trying to assuage our blizzard of worries is to look at each in turn and marshal sensible arguments against their probabilities. But it can, at points, also be helpful not to look at the specifics of every worry and instead to consider the overall position that worry has come to occupy in our lives. There is a hugely fascinating sentence on the topic in an essay by the great English psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott: 'The catastrophe you fear will happen has in fact already happened.' When we worry, we are naturally fixated on what will occur next: it's the future, with its boundless possibilities for horror, that is the natural arena for exploration by our panicked thoughts. But in Winnicott's unexpected thesis, something else is revealed: the disaster that we fear is going to unfold is actually behind us. There is a paradox here: why do we keep expecting something to happen that has already happened? Why don't we better distinguish past from present? Winnicott's answer that it's in the nature of traumatic events from childhood not to be properly processed and as a result, like the dead who have not been adequately buried and mourned, to start to haunt us indiscriminately in adulthood. But they do not make themselves felt in straightforward For example, we may panic that we are about to be humiliated and shamed. There are no particularly strong grounds for this in objective reality, but we are utterly convinced nevertheless, because this is precisely what happened to us when we were tiny and at the hands of a parent. Or we worry intensely that we are about to be abandoned in love not because our partner is in any significant way disloyal, but because someone who once looked after us at a very vulnerable point definitely was. A benefit of understanding how much our worries owe to childhood is a new sense that it isn't so much the future we should be distressed about as the past. We can replace dread and apprehension with something sadder yet ultimately more redemptive: mourning. We can feel profoundly sorry for our younger selves as an alternative to being panicked for our future selves. Appreciating the childhood legacy of worries, we also stand to realise that we can adapt and improve on how we respond to what alarms us. If we have been well parented, we will have been bequeathed a repertoire of good moves to latch on to when crises occur: we know how to reach out, seek help, perhaps move away and only take as much responsibility as we are due. We have access to a corridor through our troubles. But when we have lacked this kind of tutelage, we remain in significant ways, in relation to our troubles, like the frightened children we once were. We may be tall, drive a car and sound like a grown-up, but faced with concerns, resort to our toolkit of childlike solutions: we overreact, we go silent, we scream, we have a little sense of other options, we feel extremely limited in our powers of protest and agency, we lose all perspective. To which it is appropriate, and in no way patronising, to remind ourselves of what can – in our deeper psychological selves – still be an entirely implausible thought: that we are now adults. In other words, in response to the kinds of terror we knew so well at the age of four or eight, we don't have to be either as afraid or as powerless as we were. We can mount a direct protest, we can make an eloquent case for ourselves, we can complain and defend our position, we can rebuild our lives in a new way elsewhere. There are two ways to mitigate risk: to try to remove all risk from the world. Or to work on one's attitude to risk. Knowing that many of our fears have childhood antecedents as do our responses to them can free us to imagine that history won't have to repeat itself exactly. Adult life doesn't have to be as terrifying as our childhoods once were and our responses to our fears can have some of the greater vigour and confidence that is the natural privilege of grown-ups. We'll still be worried a substantial portion of the time, but perhaps with a little less fragility and fewer burning convictions of total upcoming catastrophe.

    "Title": "How To Be A Good Teacher",
    "Transcript": "This video is sponsored by Skillshare.  Click the link in the description for more information. A discussion of how to be a good teacher sounds a little narrow – and probably not very relevant to most of us. Few of us want to be a school teacher, instructing children in some narrow academic subject or other, which is what we overwhelmingly associate with the word 'teacher', the person in a rather frayed jacket in front of the class, the type who bored us rigid for long stretches of our early years. However, teaching is far from being something that we only need to learn if we're contemplating a career in education. Considered properly, teaching – by which we mean, the vital business of getting an important idea from one mind into another – is one of the most crucial life skills that any of us ever requires. It's vital in any relationship, office or family we'll ever belong to. Every one of us, whatever our occupation, needs to become a good teacher, for our lives constantly require us to deliver crucial information with grace and effectiveness into the deep minds of others. We can admit, quite candidly that most of us have probably started off by being quite bad teachers. This is nothing to be ashamed of, like most things, teaching can, and must be learnt. What, then, are some of the prerequisites of the good teacher? Here is a start to the list: 1. The good teacher never blames another person for not already knowing. It seems paradoxical – once it is pointed out. But the truth is we often get very annoyed by the fact that another person doesn't know something yet – even though we have never actually told them what it might be. Certain ideas can seem so important to us, we simply can't imagine that others don't already know them. We suspect they may be deliberately upsetting us by pretending not to have a clue. This attitude makes it unlikely that what we actually have to teach will make its way successfully into the unfortunate other person's head. Good teaching starts with the idea that ignorance is not a defect of the individual we're instructing: it's the consequence of never having been properly taught. So the fault, rightly, really only ever belongs with the people who haven't done enough to get the needed ideas into others' heads: in other words, with you. 2. Good teachers don't get angry The more we need other people to know something, the less we may be able to secure the calm frame of mind which is indispensable if we are to have a chance of conveying it to them effectively. The possibility that they won't quickly understand something that matters immensely to us can drive us into an agitated fury, which is the very worst state in which to conduct any lesson. By the time we've started to insult our so-called pupil, to call them a blockhead or a fool, the lesson is quite plainly over. No one has ever learnt anything under conditions of humiliation. Paradoxically, the best sort of teachers can bear the possibility that what they have to teach will not be understood. It is this slightly detached, slightly pessimistic approach that stands the best chance of generating the relaxed frame of mind essential to successful pedagogy. 3. Good teachers can admit they don't know lots of things It's pretty humiliating to be in the learning position. Someone else has information you don't. That can be so irritating, the person learning may shut their ears and hate the alleged superiority of the one in the teaching role. That's why another fundamental skill of the good teacher is to admit that they are, in most areas of life, pretty ignorant and stupid. This might seem to undermine their authority. Far from it; it creates an atmosphere of goodwill and modesty which puts the pupil at ease. They might not know this particular thing that's being taught but they are, overall, not inferior to the teacher – and so they can dare to face up to their ignorance in a given area and submit to the discipline of having it nicely corrected. 4. Good teachers pick their moments As bad teachers, we tend automatically to try to teach a lesson at the moment the problem arises, rather than selecting a time when it is most likely to be attended to properly. Crises aren't the best times for a lesson. We might have to wait a long time, three days after an argument for example, in order to pick just the opportune occasion to deal with its underlying dynamics. When our partner is stacking the dishwasher and humming a song might be wisest moment cheerfully and innocently to refer back to something that truly maddened us a little while back, but over which we were – at the time – sagely silent. As we're beginning to see, the more desperate we feel inside, the less likely we are to get through to others effectively. It is deeply unfortunate that we typically end up addressing the most delicate and complex teaching tasks just when we feel most irritated and distressed. We suffer from a panicked feeling that if we don't jump on this right now, an issue is going to go on and on unchecked forever. Precisely not. We should be more confident that not jumping on an issue is what is in fact going to allow us to fix it properly a little way down the line. 5. Good Teachers are also Good Students. Good teachers know that everyone has a lot to learn and everyone has something important to impart to others. We should never get incensed if someone is trying to teach us something and snap back, 'I wanted you to like me just as I am'. Only a perfect being would be committed to staying just as they are. For all the rest of us, good learning and teaching are the only ways we'll ever be able to progress and grow and that's why we should welcome them as the gifts they truly are.

    "Title": "The Miracle of Parenthood",
    "Transcript": "This video is sponsored by Skillshare, click the link in the description for more information. Most of our lives are spent in situations of numbing sterility. There is usually no option but to conform and obey boring rules. We don't in our work generally create anything of particular wonder or interest. We don't know how to paint or play Chopin's Scherzo No. 2 in B flat minor. We can't personally manufacture an iphone; we don't don't know how to extract oil from the ground. And yet, without being conscious of the specifics, we are at points capable of doing something properly miraculous: we can make another person. We can conjure up the limbs and organs of a fellow creature. We can create a liver, we can design someone else's brain, we can – by ingesting a mixed diet perhaps including bananas, cheese sandwiches and ginger biscuits – make fingers, we can connect neurones that will transmit thoughts about the history of the Ancient Persians or the workings of the dishwasher. We can choreograph the birth of an organic machine that will probably still be going close to a hundred years from now. We can be the master coordinator and chief designer of a product more advanced than any technology and more complex and interesting than the greatest work of art. Having a child definitively refutes any worry about our lack of creativity and dismantles (at least for while) the envy we might otherwise feel about the inventiveness of others. They may have written a stirring song, started and sold a bio-engineering company or plotted an engaging novel. But we will have created the oddest yet most inspiring work of art and science around: one that is alive; one that will develop its own centers of happiness and secrecy; that will one day do its homework, get a job, hate us, forgive us, end up being, despite itself, a bit like us and eventually, make humans of its own that can spawn themselves into perpetuity. However much they may resent one another, grow apart or be worn down by the humdrum nature of family life, parents and children are never entirely able to get past the supernatural sequence of events that connects creators and created. Because two people met fifteen years ago in a friend's kitchen, liked the look of one another, swapped phone numbers and went out for dinner, there is now – across the table – a being with a particular sort of nose, a distinctive emotional temperament and a way of smiling that (as everyone remarks) unnervingly echoes that of a dead maternal grandfather.  Parenting ineluctably demands that one address the greatest, founding philosophical question: what is a good life? As we go about answering it live in our words and actions over long years, we will at least know that we have been spared the one great fear that otherwise haunts us and usually manifests itself around work: that of not being able to make a difference. There will not be the remotest danger of lacking impact, only of unwittingly exerting the wrong kind. We will as parents be the biographers, coaches, teachers, chefs, photographers, masters and slaves of our new charges. Our work will lend us the opportunity to show our worst, but also our best selves in action: it is the particular words we will find, the touch of our hands, the encouraging look only we will be able to give, the swerve towards lenience or the brave defence of principles that will make a decisive difference to the sorrows and joys of another human being. Who we are every day, the specific individuals we will have matured into, will have an unparalleled power to exert a beneficial influence on somebody else's life. We will – in our role as parents – be terrified, exhausted, resentful, enchanted and forever spared any lingering doubt as to our significance or role on the earth.

    "Title": "Why Truly Sociable People Hate Parties",
    "Transcript": "The idea of being a sociable person is nowadays heavily associated with finding enjoyment in going to, and in all likelihood also in giving, parties. To be sociable means welcoming the idea of being in a room replete with an above-average number of other guests, many of whom will be unknown, most of whom will be holding a glass of alcohol, bantering, with lights lower than they normally would be, and music somewhat higher than required in order faithfully to catch the details of another's voice. Parties have become synonymous with sociability because of certain underlying ideas about what true social connection might require and entail. We assume that sociability naturally springs up when lots of people are put together in a room, that it means speaking a lot and notably cheerfully about things that have been happening in our lives, that it depends on a jokey manner and – ideally – on the possession of a few entertaining anecdotes, often involving striking coincidences. But such assumptions sidestep two sizeable objections. Firstly, true sociability – that is a real connection between two people – is almost never built up via anything cheerful. It is the result of making ourselves vulnerable before another person, by revealing some of is broken, lost, confused, lonely and in pain within us. We build genuine connections when we dare to exchange thoughts that might leave us open to humiliation and judgement; we make real friends through sharing in an uncensored and frank way a little of the agony and confusion of being alive. Secondly, true sociability requires a context. We are generally under such pressure to appear normal, self-possessed and solid, we are understandably uninclined spontaneously to disclose our true selves. Our default mode is – without anything sinister being meant by this – to lie about who we are and what is really going on in our lives. This suggests that a genuinely social occasion might be rather different from what we typically envisage. We think of a 'good host' as someone who makes sure there is enough wine and, at a pinch, ensures people know each other's names. But in the profound sense, a good host is someone who creates the conditions in which strangers can start to feel safe about being sad and desperate together. Unfortunately, the modern world seems particularly resistant to anything that seems artificial around parties, which threatens to evoke that most dreaded of all social genres: the corporate get-together. The thought is simply to pack a room and leave the rest to nature. But a commitment to deep sociability might lead us to recognise that we depend on a little artful choreography to get us into the psychological zone in which connections can unfold. We might need encouragement – and even a helpful lanyard – to share a little of what is sad within us. We need help in networking, not in order to find new investment opportunities but so as to identify shared regrets, humiliations and feelings of despair. Parties as they are currently structured constitute a clever ruse by a sharp minority, perhaps only ten per cent of humanity, to persuade the rest of us that we have been provided with the social contact we crave. But, in truth, it takes a sharply insular and misanthropic person to feel that what goes on in an average party really counts as anything like the requisite encounter with one's fellow human animal. If we have a lingering horror of parties, we should be generous towards our hunches. It doesn't mean that we don't like other people, rather that we have too ambitious a conception of social contact to put up with what is on offer at most parties. The mark of a truly sociable person might, in many situations, simply be a strong desire to stay at home.

    "Title": "How Our Past Influences Our Present",
    "Transcript": "For much of the time, the way we feel about - and react to - events is founded on how things are in the here and now. For example: - I feel very scared because something very scary is in front of me. - I feel I'm being judged harshly by the person I'm speaking to - and I am. - I withhold my trust because someone I'm with truly is untrustworthy However, one of the momentous discoveries of 20th century psychology has been that in certain cases, this isn't what happens at all. At points, our behaviour is driven not by what is happening in front of us, but by extremely formative experiences we've had in childhood, which colour and influence how we behave and think decades later - unless and until we become aware of our tendencies, as the technical term has it, to 'project' responses from the past onto the present, where they don't entirely belong. So: - We feel very scared - even though there is nothing around us to be terrified of. - We feel harshly judged by someone - who in fact means very well. - We avoid intimacy with a person - who actually deeply merits our trust The reason we behave like is that we are generalising on the basis of certain significant events from childhood which have completely altered our assumptions about the world and other people. - In early childhood, we experienced the terrifying volcanic temper of a violent parent. Now we see the threat of violence everywhere. - We were humiliated by our mother for the first decade of life. Now a lot of people seem out to humiliate us. - A father whom we loved and trusted left the family and broke off contact suddenly. Now most relationships feel like they're about to end in disaster. When we're involved in a projection, we believe ourselves to be utterly justified in responding as we do, and might take deep offence if someone accused us of 'projecting' on the basis of forgotten past events. Because of this innate denial and ignorance of our projections, psychologists have developed special tests, known as projection tests, to tease out our underlying assumptions, show us what is on our minds and enable us to see reality more clearly. The most well-known of such tecsts was devised in the 1930s by the Swiss psychologist Hermann Rorschach, who created a group of ambiguous images, then asked his patients to reflect without inhibition on what they felt these looked like, evoked and made them think of. Crucially, these images have no predetermined meaning; they aren't about anything in particular. They are suggestive in a huge variety of directions - and so different people will see different traits and atmospheres in them according to what their past most readily predisposes them to imagine. To one individual who has inherited from their parents a rather kindly and forgiving conscience, an image could be seen as a sweet mask, with eyes, floppy ears, a covering for the mouth and wide flaps extending from the cheeks. Another, more traumatised by a domineering father, might see it as a powerful figure viewed from below, with splayed feet, thick legs, heavy shoulders and the head bent forward as if poised for attack. With similar intent, the psychologists Henry Murray and Christiana Morgan created a set of drawings showing people whose moods and actions were deliberately indeterminate. In one example, two men are positioned close to one another with their faces able to bear a host of interpretations. 'It's perhaps a father and son, mourning together for a shared loss', one respondent who had inherited a close relationship with his father might say. Or another, bearing the burden of a punitive past, might assert: 'It's a manager in the process of sacking a young employee who has failed at an important task'. Or a third, wrestling with a legacy of censured homosexuality, might venture: 'I feel something obscene is going on out of the frame: it's in a public urinal, the older man is looking at the younger guy's penis and making him feel very embarrassed but perhaps also somehow turned on....' One thing we do really know about these ambiguous images is that they are not precise, the elaboration is coming from the person who looks at them, and the way they elaborate, the kind of story they tell, is saying far more about their emotional inheritance than it does about the images themselves. Following this pattern, in the 1950s, the American psychologist Saul Rosenzweig designed tests to tease out our inherited ways of dealing with humiliation and bad news. His Picture Frustration Study (1955) showed a range of situations to which our psychological histories would give us very different templates of responses. One kind of person, the bearer of a solid emotional inheritance, will tend to be resilient when someone has behaved badly towards them or is causing a problem unnecessarily. Another might be convinced that they they deserve quite bad treatment from others, a legacy of a difficult childhood. A fourth projection exercise asks us to say the very first thing that comes to mind when we try to finish particular sentences that are fired at us. For example: Men in authority are generally… Young women are almost always… When I am promoted, what's bound to happen is… When someone is late, it must be because… When I hear someone described as 'very intellectual', I imagine them being…[d] Being mature means accepting with good grace that we might be involved in multiple projections and so may be bringing exaggerated dynamics and excess energy to a lot of situations. We aren't of course responsible for the events in childhood from which our projections arose, but we do have a responsibility as adults to try to understand the nature of our projections - and to warn others, and ourselves, of how they might be skewing our behaviour in the here and now.

    "Title": "Make Your Bias Work for You",
    "Transcript": "A presumption among many thoughtful people is that the great enemy of a good life and a decent world is something called 'bias'. By bias, people have come to understand a twisting of the facts towards dark and entirely negative ends. According to this interpretation, bias is invariably and necessarily bad. In some quarters, the word has simply grown synonymous with evil. In order to hate bias so much, one has to love the idea of something else with equal passion: 'the facts'. People hate bias because they ultimately believe in the redemptive possibility of something completely objective, and scientifically verifiable. Loathing of bias is the flipside of faith in facts. Facts evidently exist in many areas of life. Science and many of the human sciences are beautifully based on evidence-based, fact-yielding work. The problem is that in many of the most important aspects of existence, there simply are no 'facts' available. The big questions that bedevil us, individually and collectively, have no facts to appeal to. – How should we live? – what is the right economic system to institute? – what sort of relationships should we have? – what choices should we make? – Who are we and what do we want and need? In the face of such dilemmas, we may well long for facts – by which we really mean, answers we can be assured will be indisputably correct. But we invariably face ambiguity and, whatever answers we formulate, a degree of loss, and the risk of blindness and error. It is these elements which the haters of bias are, deep down, especially intolerant towards and upset about. Their hatred of bias reflects a longing for a world without a need for hard choices and the sacrifice these necessarily entail. We may well long to 'stick to facts,' but we eventually have to try to lead our lives according to values, which are inherently much more contentious and complicated structures. There is no merely fact-based road to a good and contented life. The passion against bias often comes to a head in our thinking about news organisations. In certain circles, there is a particular loathing for what is termed biased news – and a belief in the option of decent news organisations which are going to always and inherently be unbiased. Unfortunately, there is simply no way of providing factual, 'unbiased' answers to the really big issues facing societies. News organisations that vaunt their neutrality forget that neutrality is simply impossible vis a vis the really urgent questions confronting our civilisation. The word 'bias' ultimately simply alludes to the business of having a 'take' on existence. One may have a better or worse take, but one needs a take. One needs eventually to tackle the question of what is important, just, worth striving for. If news or information or even philosophy are to matter to us, really matter, they will have to be presented to us by organisations that have tried to think through the ends of human life, that have a vision of where we are trying to go as a species, and that have somewhere articulated their answers to their audiences. The issue is not – therefore – the illusory and timid one between bias and fact but between better and worse varieties of bias. We should never knock (to take the most obvious examples) America's Fox News or Britain's Daily Mail just on the basis that they are biased, we should only ever argue that they seem badly biased. That is the battle to fight. We also need an extension of our sense of what sort of bias can exist. At present, we are used to thinking of bias simply in terms of right and left. But this is a radical reduction in the kinds of bias that are theoretically available to us. We don't always have to limits things to a choice between blue and red. We might discover a bias in favour of the wisdom of Montaigne, the dark consoling pessimism of Schopenhauer or the wit and humanity of Marcel Proust. We could be biased towards ambiguity, cheerful despair or sane insanity. Our societies would be richer if we were better, not at stripping facts of bias, but at developing our capacities for higher bias. All individuals and organisations – even ones like the BBC, Wikipedia or a great university – in fact, believe in all sorts of things deep down; they aren't as neutral as they want us to think – and that's an extremely good thing. It's high time for them to stop hiding behind a false defence of their factual impartiality and to come out from behind the shadows with a clear articulation of their vision of a good society. It's time for biases to conflict openly, as part of a healthy democratic process. We don't need our information stripped of bias, we need to evolve our way, through a clash of ideologies, towards the best kinds of bias. Furthermore, we'll have matured when we start to know what our own biases really are – and so start to get less prickly and touchy about the biases of others.

    "Title": "What Is an Emotionally-healthy Childhood?",
    "Transcript": "We can sometimes be so modest about our power to know what might be good for others or ourselves, we forget it might be possible to hazard a few generalisations about what constitutes an emotionally healthy childhood. It can't be pure idiosyncracy or good luck; there are distinct themes and goals to identify. With a map of optimal development in mind, we could more clearly appreciate where dislocation begins, what we have to be grateful for and what there is to regret. At a collective level, we would have more of a sense of what we need to achieve to generate a more emotionally-privileged – and therefore slightly saner – world. In the course of an emotionally healthy childhood, we could expect some of the following to occur: – Someone will put themselves profoundly at our service. If as adults we have even a measure of mental health, it is almost certainly because, when we were helpless tiny infants, there was a person (to whom we essentially owe our lives) who pushed their needs to one side for a time in order to focus wholly on our own. They interpreted what we could not quite say, they guessed what might be ailing us, they settled and consoled us. They kept the chaos and noise at bay and cut the world up into manageable pieces for us. They did not, all the while, ask that we thank them, understand them or show them sympathy. They didn't demand that we enquire how their days went or how they were sleeping at night (they weren't much). They treated us like royalty, so that we would later on be able to submit to the rigours and humiliations of an ordinary life. This temporarily one-sided relationship guaranteed our eventual ability to form a two-sided kind. We may think of egoists as people who have grown sick from too much love. But the opposite is rather the case; an egoist is someone who has not yet had their fill. Self-centeredness has to have a clean run in the early years, if it isn't to haunt and ruin the later ones. The so-called narcissist is simply a benighted soul who has not had a chance to be inordinately and unreasonably admired at the start. – In an emotionally-healthy childhood, someone is on hand to put the best possible spin on our behaviour. We're given the benefit of the doubt. We are assessed by what we might one day be, not by exactly what we are right now. Someone is kind. A harsh judge might, for example, say that we were 'attention-seeking'. Our caregiver imagines that what we most stand in need of is a hug and some encouraging words. We might have acted rather meanly. Our caregiver adds that we must, in the background, have been feeling threatened. It looked as if we were negligent; the caregiver remembers that tiredness could have had a lot to do with it. Our carer constantly searches beneath the surface for a more sympathetic set of explanations. They help us to be on our own side, to like ourselves – and therefore eventually not to be too defensive about our own flaws, whose existence we grow strong enough to accept. – In a good childhood, the relationship with our caregiver is steady, consistent and long-term. We trust that they will be there tomorrow and the day after. They aren't volatile or fragile. They are almost boringly predictable and happy to be taken for granted. As a result, we develop a trust in relationships that spreads throughout our life. We are able to believe that what has gone well once can go well again and let such an expectation govern our choice of adult partners. We aren't mesmerised by people who are off-hand and unreliable; we don't relish being punished. We can pick out candidates who are kind and nurturing – and don't judge them as weak or deficient for being so. And if trouble strikes with our kindly partners, we don't panic anxiously or avoidantly turn away. We can confidently set about trying to repair a love we know we deserve. – In an emotionally healthy upbringing, we aren't always required to be wholly good boys or girls. We are allowed to get furious and sometimes a bit revolting, at points to say 'absolutely not' and 'because I feel like it'. The adults know their own flaws and do not expect a child to be fundamentally better than they are. We do not have to comply at every turn to be tolerated. We can let others see our shadow sides. This period of freedom prepares us one day to submit to the demands of society without having to rebel in self-defeating ways (rebels being, at heart, people who had to obey too much too early). We can knuckle down and tow the line when it's in our long-term interest to do so. At the same time, we're not overly cowed or indiscriminately obedient either. We find a sound middle point between slavish compliance on the one hand and self-destructive defiance on the other. – In the emotionally healthy home, our carer isn't jealous of or competitive with us. They can allow themselves to be overtaken and superseded. They have had their moment in the limelight – or else are having it elsewhere beyond the family. They can be proud rather than rivalrous of the achievements of the (usually same-sex) child. It doesn't all need to be about them. The good carer isn't overly ambitious on the child's behalf. They want them to do well, but for their own sake, in their own way. There is no particular script the offspring has to follow to be loved; the child isn't required to support the carer's frayed self-belief or burnish their image in the eyes of the world. – In the emotionally healthy upbringing, the child learns that things which break can be fixed. Plans can go awry, but new ones can be made. You can fall over and dust yourself off. The carer models for the child how to calm down, plough on and remain hopeful. A voice of resilience, originally external, becomes the way the child learns to speak to themselves. There are alternatives to panic; the ship will endure the storm and make it back to harbour. It is safe enough to go outside and explore. There aren't dangers at every turn. We can make little forays at first, then come back for reassurance – only to return for another, longer journey of exploration. We can take risks. – Importantly, plenty goes wrong in the emotionally healthy childhood. No one has staked their reputation on rendering the whole thing perfect. The carer does not see it as their role to remove every frustration. They intuit that a lot of good comes from having the right, manageable kind of friction – through which the child develops their own resources and individuality. In contact with bearable disappointment, the child is prompted to create their own internal world, in which they can dream, hatch fresh plans, self-soothe and build up their own resources. – The good carer isn't, the child can see, either entirely good or wholly bad and so isn't worthy of either idealisation or denigration. The child accepts the faults and virtues of the carer with melancholy maturity and gratitude – and thereby, by extension, becomes ready to accept that everyone they like will be a mixture of positive and negative. They won't as adults fall deeply in love and then grow furious at the first moment of let-down. They have a realistic sense of what can be expected of life alongside another good enough human. Soberingly, despite all our advances in technology and material resources, we are not much more advanced in the art of delivering emotionally healthy childhoods than previous generations. The number of breakdowns, inauthentic lives and broken souls shows no marked signs of decline. We are failing to offer one another tolerable childhoods not because we are evil or indifferent but because we still have so far to go before we know how to do that most apparently simple yet infinitely complicated of things: love.

    "Title": "NIETZSCHE ON: Amor Fati",
    "Transcript": "One of the strangest yet most intriguing aspects of Friedrich Nietzsche's ideas is his repeated enthusiasm for a concept that he called amor fati (translated from Latin as 'a love of one's fate', or as we might put it, a resolute, enthusiastic acceptance of everything that has happened in one's life). The person of amor fati doesn't seek to erase anything of their past, but rather accepts what has occurred, the good and the bad, the mistaken and the wise, with strength and an all-embracing gratitude that borders on a kind of enthusiastic affection. This refusal to regret and retouch the past is heralded as a virtue at many points in Nietzsche's work. In his book, The Gay Science, written during a period of great personal hardship for the philosopher, Nietzsche writes: I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who makes things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer. And, a few years later, in Ecce Homo Nietzsche writes: My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it… but love it. In most areas of life, most of the time, we do the very opposite. We spend a huge amount of time taking stock of our errors, regretting and lamenting the unfortunate twists of fate – and wishing that things could have gone differently. We are typically mighty opponents of anything that smacks of resignation or fatalism. We want to alter and improve things – ourselves, politics, the economy, the course of history – and part of this means refusing to be passive about the errors, injustices and ugliness of our own and the collective past. Nietzsche himself, in some moods, knows this defiance full well. There is much emphasis in his work on action, initiative and self-assertion. His concept of the Wille zur Macht, or Will to Power embodies just this attitude of vitality and conquest over obstacles. However, he is aware that, in order to lead a good life, we need to keep in mind plenty of opposing ideas and marshall them as and when they become relevant. We don't – in Nietzsche's eyes – need to be consistent, we need to have the ideas to hand that can salve our wounds. Nietzsche isn't therefore asking us to choose between glorious fatalism on the one hand or a vigorous willing on the other. He is allowing us to have recourse to either intellectual move depending on the occasion. He wishes our mental toolkit to have more than one set of ideas: to have, as it were, both a hammer and a saw. Certain occasions particularly need the wisdom of a Will driven philosophy; others demand that we know how to accept, embrace and stop fighting the inevitable. In Nietzsche's own life, there was much that he had tried to change and overcome. He had fled his restrictive family in Germany and escaped to the Swiss Alps; he had tried to get away from the narrowness of academia and become a freelance writer; he had tried to find a wife who could be both a lover and an intellectual soulmate. But a lot in this project of self-creation and self-overcoming had gone terribly wrong. He couldn't get his parents, especially his mother and sister out of his head. Nietzche's books sold dismally and he was forced more or less to beg from friends and family in order to keep going. Meanwhile his halting, gauche attempts to seduce women were met by ridicule and rejection. There must have been so many lamentations and regrets running through his mind in his walks across the Upper Engadine and his nights in his modest wooden chalet in Sils Maria: if only I had stuck with an academic career; if only I'd been more confident around certain women; if only I'd written in a more popular style; if only I'd been born in France… It was because such thoughts – and every one of us has our own distinct variety of them – can ultimately be so destructive and soul-sapping that the idea of 'amor fati' grew compelling to Nietzsche. Amor fati was the idea that he needed in order to regain sanity after hours of self-recrimination and criticism. It's the idea we ourselves may need at 4 a.m. finally to quieten a mind that has started gnawing into itself shortly after midnight. It's an idea with which a troubled spirit can greet the first signs of dawn. At the height of the mood of amor fati, we recognise that things really could not have been otherwise, because everything we are and have done is bound closely together in a web of consequences that began with our birth – and which we are powerless to alter at will. We see that what went right and what went horribly wrong are as one, and we commit ourselves to accepting both, to no longer destructively hoping that things could have been otherwise. We were headed to a degree of catastrophe from the start. We end up saying, with tears in which there mingle grief and a sort of ecstasy, a large yes to the whole of life, in its absolute horror and occasional moments of awesome beauty. In a letter to a friend written in the summer of 1882, Nietzsche tried to sum up the new spirit of acceptance that he had learnt to lean on to protect him from his agony: 'I am in a mood of fatalistic 'surrender to God' ⎯ I call it amor fati, so much so, that I would be willing to rush into a lion's jaws'. And that is where, after too much regret, we should learn sometimes to join him.

    "Title": "The Attractiveness of Unhappy Looking People",
    "Transcript": "We are often taught that the best way to prove attractive is to smile. The idea feels logical and for the most part highly appropriate, but it shouldn't blind us to the occasional claims of a contrary minority approach, this one founded on an awareness that friendship between people is ultimately based not on boosterish accounts of recent triumphs, but on the possibility of shared grief, sadness and melancholy. This may explain the surprisingly intense charm of attractive people who are resolutely not smiling – but instead look lost in thought, absorbed by their own sorrows and taken up with an internal dialogue around pain and loss. They may well pull a smile if asked, but it will be obviously rather strained, and brief, like a moment of sunshine between dark grey clouds. They are beautiful not despite their sadness, but – however curious this sounds – precisely because of it. In the Western artistic tradition, the most prominent sad beautiful person was – for many centuries – the mother of Jesus. In many representations, Mary was elegant, serene and poised, but she was also – quite obviously – sunk in sorrow and concern. But the sadness did not detract from her appeal. Rather, it made the viewer feel in the presence of someone who would be in a position to understand their own sorrows, someone around whom it would not be necessary to put up a front in the name of seeming normal. hansmemling_diptychofmaartennieuwenhove-detail2 Our longing for love is, at heart, powered by a desire to be understood and to understand. Given how much of life is tragic in structure, it follows that for many of us, the sort of people we feel readiest to love are not going to be those who find the business of living obvious or easy; but those who are as puzzled and saddened by it as we are; those who feel a regular need to withdraw from the sentimental bonhomie of daily life; those who are alive to anxiety and catastrophe – and who may, like us, frequently feel close to tears at so much that is regretful and sad. We have been keen to pathologise and medicalise expressions of unhappiness – and our ideals of physical beauty have kept pace with our prejudices. Our billboards and movies loudly proclaim the virtues of glowing contentment. But we are in danger of missing out on one of the richest sources of beauty, which is when our faces drop their usual masks and visually acknowledge the pain of existence – a moment of honesty and vulnerability on the basis of which true friendship and love can arise.

    "Title": "The Dangers of Thinking Too Much; And Thinking Too Little",
    "Transcript": "Thinking about ourselves – our feelings, our past, our desires and our hopes – is a hugely tricky task that most of spend a good deal of effort trying very hard to avoid. We keep away from ourselves because so much of what we could discover threatens to be painful. We might find that we were, in the background, deeply furious with, and resentful about, certain people we were only meant to love. We might discover how much ground there was to feel inadequate and guilty on account of the many errors and misjudgements we have made. We might find that though we wanted to be decent, law-abiding people, we harboured fantasies that went in appallingly deviant and aberrant directions. We might recognise how much was nauseatingly compromised and needed to be changed about our relationships and careers. We don't only have a lot to hide, we are liers of genius. It is part of the human tragedy that we are such natural self-deceivers. Our techniques are multiple and close to invisible. Two are worth focusing on in particular: our habit of thinking too much. And our proclivity for thinking too little. When we think too much, in essence, we are filling our minds with impressive ideas, which blatantly announce our intelligence to the world but subtly ensure we won't have much room left to rediscover long-distant feelings of ignorance or confusion – upon which the development of our personalities nevertheless rests. We write dense books on the role of government bonds in the Napoleonic wars or publish extensively on Chaucer's influence on the mid-19th century Japanese novel. We secure degrees from Institutes of Advanced Study or positions on editorial boards of scientific journals. Our minds are crammed with arcane data. We can wittily inform a dining table of guests who wrote the Enchiridion (Epictetus) or the life and times of Dōgen (the founder of Zen Buddhism). But we don't remember very much at all about how life was long ago, back in the old house, when father left, mother stopped smiling and our trust broke in pieces. We deploy knowledge and ideas that carry indubitable prestige to stand guard against the emergence of more humble, but essential knowledge from our emotional past. We bury our personal stories beneath an avalanche of expertise. The possibility of a deeply consequential intimate enquiry is deliberately left to seem feeble and superfluous next to the supposedly grander task of addressing a conference on the political strategies of Dona Maria the First or the life-cycle of the Indonesian octopus. We lean on the glamour of being learned to make sure we won't need to learn too much that hurts. Then there is our habit of thinking too little. Here we pretend that we are simpler than we really are and that too much psychology might be nonsense and fuss about nothing. We lean on a version of robust common-sense to ward off intimations of our own awkward complexity. We imply that not thinking very much is, at base, evidence of a superior kind of intelligence. In company, we deploy bluff strategies of ridicule against more complex accounts of human nature. We sideline avenues of personal investigation as unduly fancy or weird, implying that to lift the lid on inner life could never be fruitful or entirely respectable. We use the practical mood of Monday morning 9 a.m. to ward off the complex insights of 3.a.m. the previous night, when the entire fabric of our existence came into question against the backdrop of a million stars, spread like diamonds on a mantle of black velvet. Deploying an attitude of vigorous common sense, we strive to make our moments of radical disquiet seem like aberrations – rather than the central occasions of insight they might actually be. We appeal to the understandable longing that our personalities be non-tragic, simple and easily comprehended – so as to reject the stranger, but more useful facts of our real, intricate selves. A defence of emotional honesty has nothing to do with high minded morality. It is ultimately cautionary and egoistic. We need to tell ourselves a little more of the truth because we pay too high a price for our lies. Through our deceptions, we cut ourselves off from possibilities of growth. We shut off large portions of our minds and end up uncreative, tetchy and defensive, while others around us have to suffer our irritability, gloom, manufactured cheerfulness or defensive rationalisations. Our neglect of the awkward sides of ourselves buckles our very being, emerging as insomnia or impotence, stuttering or depression; revenge for all the thoughts we have been so careful not to have. Self-knowledge isn't a luxury so much as a precondition for a measure of sanity and inner comfort. .

    "Title": "Why We  Should Not Watch Quite so Much News",
    "Transcript": "We know that we must, to lay claim to any respectability or competence, keep up with the news. That's why we've ringed the earth with satellites, crisscrossed it with fiber optic cables, and created networks of bureaus that inform us with maniacal urgency of pretty much any event to have unfolded anywhere on the planet in the last few moments. We are, furthermore, equipped with tiny devices that we keep very close to hand, and which we tend to check at intervals of between one and five minutes (rarely longer) so as to monitor all unfolding stories in close to real time. We have been granted a ringside seat on the second by second flow of history. As a result we see a lot more. And at the same time, strangely, we see a lot less. The constant presence of news from without hampers our ability to pick up on an equally important, though far less prestigious source of news from within. We are not, by nature, well equipped to see inside ourselves. Consciousness bobs like a small boat on a sea of disavowed emotions. A lot of feelings and ideas require a high degree of courage to confront. They threaten to make us uncomfortably anxious, excited or sad were we to learn more about them. So we use the news without to silence the news from within. We have the most prestigious excuse ever invented never to spend any time roaming freely inside our own minds. It is not that the news from without is unimportant to someone (indeed, it will be the most important thing in certain people's lives a continent away or in a company in the capital or somewhere in the upper reaches of government), it's just that this news is almost certainly wholly disconnected from our real priority over the coming years; which is to make the most of our life and our talents in the time that remains to us. It is touching that we should give so much of our curiosity over to strangers, but it is poignant that we are forced eventually to pay such a high price for this constant dispersal of energy. We dismiss fragile, tentative thoughts about what we should do next, who we should call, what we really need to do, thoughts upon which an adequate future for us depends – for the sake of the more obvious drama of the moment. But the drama won't save us, and cares not a jot about our development or our real responsibilities. It feels counter-intuitive to think that there might be certain things more important than the news. But there is: our own lives – which we have, troublingly, been granted such prestigious reasons and means to avoid confronting. We can educate ourselves in the art of being calm. Not through special teas or slow breathing but through thinking.  This book guides us through that process."

    "Title": "Why Our Best Thoughts Come to Us in the Shower",
    "Transcript": "We might suppose that the best place to think would be a large room with a big desk, plenty of natural light and a window with a view – perhaps onto water or a park. This is the premise behind the layout of most offices. The nearer one gets to the top, the closer one's work station will approximate to this supposed ideal: in tribute to the quality of thinking that, ideally, one would do there. Bosses tend to have big desks and even larger views. But these assumption are not – in fact – really true to the way our minds work. The primary obstacle to good thinking is not a cramped desk or an uninteresting horizon. It is, first and foremost, anxiety. Often the most profound thoughts we need to grapple with have a potentially disturbing character. If we were to pinpoint them accurately and get clear about their significance, there could be a risk. We might discover that some of our past, rather cherished, beliefs were not as wise as we'd supposed; we might realise we were previously deeply wrong about something; we might have to make some significant and tricky changes to our lives. As these potential implications start to come vaguely into view, our inner censor, motivated by a desire for calm rather than growth, gets alarmed. A vigilant part of the self gets agitated; it distracts us, it makes us feel tired or gives us a strong need to go online. Skilfully, it confuses and muddles our train of thought. It blocks the progress we were starting to make towards ideas that – though important and interesting – also presented marked threats to short-term peace. It in this context that the shower emerges as so helpful to the way our minds work and earns the right to be honoured as one of the best places on earth in which to do any kind of serious reflection. Amidst the crashing water and the steam and with a few minutes of respite before the day starts, the mind is no longer on guard. We're not supposed to be doing much inside our heads; we're mainly occupied with trying to soap our backs and properly rinse our hair. The ideas that have been half-forming at the back of our minds, ideas about what the true purpose of our lives might be and what we should do next, keep up their steady inward pressure – but now there is a lot less to stop them reaching full consciousness. We're not meant to be thinking and so – at last – we can think freely and courageously. .This quality of sufficient – but not overwhelming – distraction might equally well be present when we're driving down the highway or walking in a forest; when there's just enough for the managerial timid side of the mind to be doing to keep it from interfering with our authentic and bolder inner machinations. Our world places a very high premium on good ideas – but spends very little serious effort in investigating why we find it extraordinarily hard to hatch them. Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote: 'In the minds of geniuses, we find our own neglected thoughts.' In other words, so-called geniuses don't have thoughts different from the ones most of us have. They're just a lot better at not allowing their inhibitions and preconceptions to get in the way of properly entertaining them. In a utopian future, we would get a lot more creative about what real thinking is and where it happens. We'd learn that the real enemy of good thinking isn't a small desk or a modest view: it is – almost always – anxiety, for which there can be few better cures than that library of our deeper selves: the morning shower.

    "Title": "Our OBSESSION with Diminutives",
    "Transcript": "The world is a vast and often unmanageable place - so no wonder if we sometimes display a powerful attraction to the idea of miniaturisation. We seem to love dollhouses, teddies, train sets, bonzai trees, model airplanes and tiny cups and saucers sitting on the sides of miniaturized kitchens. These please us by symbolising a taming and humanising of the gigantic dimensions of much of life. By far the easiest and fastest way to miniaturise the world is not by making models of it, but through the use of what linguists call: DIMINUTIVES A diminutive is a word that has been modified to suggest the smaller version of itself - usually through a tweak to its ending. Interestingly, the moment we're tempted to use a diminutive is often the moment we start to love someone or something. The more we feel drawn, the more we want to possess them, to tame their otherness and intimidating scale, and therefore to shrink them down to something more manageable, something that might slip into our pocket. When a couple, let's call them Emma and Brad get together, they might swiftly add some diminutives to their burgeoning relationship. His vagabond footloose sides can be tamed by a little y, so that he becomes Brad-y. And Emma might shrink by being called Emm-ie. It's particularly interesting to find that not all languages use diminutives to the same extent. The champion is Spanish, especially as spoken in Latin America. Latin Americans are constantly trying to shrink everything. In Mexico “ahora” (in a minute) becomes “ahorita”, in just a little second. “Un poco”, a little, gets changed in “un poquitín”, just a smidgeon. A coffee, “un café”, is constantly changed into “un cafelín” or “un cafelito.” That doesn't make your coffee any smaller, but it brings you into a more intimate relationship to it. Italian is another language very keen on diminutives, usually with the addition of an “ino” or “ina”. An old man: in Italian un vecchio becomes un vecchietto A little boy ragazzo → ragazzino A woman (donna → donnetta) A small car (macchina → macchinetta) German, often seen as a formal, harsh language, also has a flair for diminutives. The suffixes “-chen”, “-lein” can be added to many words. A sausage, “ein Wurst”, can be turned into “ein Würstchen”, which isn't necessarily a smaller sausage but one that is particularly irresistible. Likewise “ein Hündchen” isn't necessarily a smaller dog than “ein Hund” but it's probably one you have a soft spot for. The major language notable for its lack of diminutives is English: at best, we can add a “-y” or a 'let', very poor moves compared the great richness of diminutives in other languages. We might wonder why this is. Perhaps English, the global language, the language of conquest and Empire, resists the accommodation with the modest, the everyday and the tender which other languages pave the way for. We may lack diminutives because it is that little bit harder to be tender in English - or, more importantly, as an English person. Diminutives do the valuable job of rehabilitating sweetness. They remind us that we have come from childhood and that when we love, we want to shrink the world back down to a more manageable and loveable scale. We know that we are the objects of someone's affection when they start to shrink us down - and we shouldn't hesitate to shrink down the bits of the world we have begun to care for.

    "Title": "Anxiety Attacks",
    "Transcript": "Anxiety attacks are sometimes interpreted, by society at large but also by their confused, guilty or shamed sufferers, as an illness close to madness: the result of a mysterious chemically-based flaw in the brain that severs us from reality and normalcy. The suggested treatment is therefore medical, involving forceful attempts to dampen and anaesthetise parts of the misfiring mind. Yet such an interpretation - however kind in its intentions - depends on the assumption: that the normal response to the conditions of existence should be calm. But why should it be, given the obvious insanity of the world? The root cause of an anxiety attack is unusual sensitivity to a madness in the world most people dampen out. Of course, once you think about it, it's entirely understandable one might have an anxiety attack at a party, when talking to a colleague or on a crowded train. There is genuine terror beneath the surface of such things. In her great novel Middlemarch, the 19th century English writer George Eliot, a deeply self-aware but also painfully self-conscious and anxious figure, reflected on what it would be like if we were truly sensitive, open to the world and felt the implications of everything “If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel's heart beat, and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence. As it is, the quickest of us walk about well wadded with stupidity.” It is, as Eliot recognises, both a privilege and a profound nightmare to hear that grass growing and that squirrel's heart beating - and, also, by extension to feel everything deeply. We might well, as she sometimes did, long for a little more 'well-wadded stupidity' to block it all out. Nevertheless, Eliot's lines offer us a way to reinterpret our anxiety with greater dignity and benevolence. It emerges from a dose of clarity that is (currently) too powerful for us to cope with - but isn't for that matter wrong. We panic because we rightly feel how thin the veneer of civilisation is, how mysterious other people are, how improbable it is that we exist at all, how everything that seems to matter now will eventually be annihilated, how random many of the turnings of our lives are, how prey we are to accident. Anxiety is simply insight that we haven't yet found a productive use for, that hasn't yet made its way into art or philosophy. It's a mad world that insists that the anxious are the crazy ones. We are in such a hurry to see anxiety as a sickness, we fail to notice its health and wisdom. It is a legitimate, constant response to the oddity of going to parties, riding public transport or more widely, of being alive. We should never exacerbate our suffering by trying to push our disquiet aggressively away. Our lack of calm isn't deplorable or a sign of weakness. It is simply the justifiable expression of our mysterious participation in a disordered, uncertain world. We publish new, thought provoking films, every week.

    "Title": "How We Lie to Ourselves",
    "Transcript": "A major obstacle to self-knowledge and in turn, to a flourishing life, is our tendency to lie to ourselves. We lie for a very understandable reason: because we want to avoid pain. There are four things we particularly like to lie to ourselves about: Things we need to change about our lives. Things that might disturb our self-image. Things we badly want and can't have. Things we are angry with orthers about but don't dare to express. Here are some of the leading manoeuvers we employ to kid ourselves. 1. Addiction. *Pornography noises* We identify something that can powerfully keep our thoughts away from troubling inner confrontations. Often, we don't so much like what distracts us in and of itself: we get attached because of its ability to keep us away from what we fear. 2. Manic Cheeriness. Guys I just want to propse a toast to friendship and yeah just to having great times together. I'm so glad you came, I hope your all having fun. A sadness we haven't been able to admit to is often covered up withexaggerated doses of manic cheeriness. Are you having fun? Yeah Yeah. I'm so happy, it's so nice to see you. Yeah you too. It's really lovely, it's really fun it's been really fun.You look amazing. We aren't happy so much as incapable of allowing ourselves to feel even the slightest sadness, in case we were to be overwhelmed by our troubling feelings. 3. Denigration. I'm pleased I didn't go to university. I know you met alot of people and that you're friends for life but I don't think that paying 9000 a year to make friends is really the best use of my money. Especially if i'm going to have to pay that back. We tell ourselves that we simply don't care about something - not because that's true, but because we can't have it. I have got a friend that does contempary movement practise. I learnt to walk when I was little I don't need to... I just learnt myself. You fall over you get up, I don't need a tutor to tell me, you know this is how movement looks in the 20th century. I just sit at the bus stop. 4. Censoriousness. So it was the village counciller. There all in the bed and breakfast and that's where it begins. It's this kind of orgy situation and I think first of all it's abuse of power. But why people need to commit to group sex? I find it so weird. We can often grow censorious and disapproving of certain people and behaviours to ward off an awareness that a part of us in fact really likes the condemmed element. and kind of creepy and discusting, I just. I do not want to be in a harness doing that kind of thing. I'm just not interested. When our feelings get tricky, we attack them in someone else. I think it's disgusting. I don't understand why someone needs to have multiple partners. 5. Defensiveness. Because you're so strong, so good and talented and it is very unique I think actually you know what would happen if you just stripped it all back and took away all the bells and whistles the effects and just kind of just went just you just the guitar. Wow. that's rude to sit there and just. Well it's quite arrogent to tell me what you think I should do with what i'm doing. What do you even know about music? You just press buttons and stuff don't you? Just press play and pause. You don't actually create any music. So for you to tell me what to do with mine is just really, it comes across really full of yourself. Feeling offended takes up all our attention. It muddies the waters. When we are defensive, we no longer pay attention to information that may - at its heart - be correct but challenging. Like you don't know what you're talking about i know what i'm doing with my music and if it doesn't appeal to you I'm sorry but you probably don't kind of know the genre that i'm going for. Or the feeling. Maybe I'm not going for a genre. The problem with lying to ourselves is that in so doing. We miss out on key opportunities for growth. Don't tell me how to do my craft in front of my friends. I know what I'm doing. You get it. You get it. You absolutely get it. The things we're in denial about are painful.  But usually also contain crucial material that's vital to our overall development. I'm so much happier being single. You know even the movies are good on your own. I didn't know that I thought it was a couple thing but even that's good now. I've got more space in the appartment. If we could face up to our stranger thoughts, needs and desires. We'd learn to navigate more freely in our minds and our honesty would render us more creative, interesting and pleasant to be around. At the school of life we believe in developing emotional intelligence. To that end we've also created a whole range of products to support that growth. Find out more at the link on yourr screen now."

    "Title": "Countries for winners; countries for losers",
    "Transcript": "We all, naturally, want to be winners. And so, consequently, a great many countries are designed to reward winners. These are the countries that pay a good deal of attention to optimising the conditions of life available to people who win. In such lands, if one is a winner and falls ill, the hospitals are outstanding: The transport laid on for winners is superlative: The housing for winners is spacious, light and uplifting: And winner children are educated in establishments that resemble five star hotels: Of course, in such lands, provisions for losers are not so quite so comfortable. There isn't the money left over. So housing for Losers can be challenging: Transport for Losers is something of a humiliation: And the children of losers start to learn young about their negligible status. This could all sound worrying, but it tends not panic us very much for one fundamental reason related to how the human minds work. Most of us naturally assume that we will – at some point – become winners. You can see this optimistic part of the brain in action in our well-observed proclivity for playing the lottery. Millions of us show an inclination to believe that we will end up holding a winning ticket – despite the daunting odds. The chances of winning the UK lottery are one in 14 million. This often isn't enough to put many of us off. If we don't play the lottery ourselves, we may feel a bit sorry for people who do. We may smile at their folly in getting statistics quite so wrong. But in the way we vote, we may display a strikingly similar mindset. We too may cast our votes for political parties determined to reward a tiny subset of winners and cast the vast majority of losers to a less dignified end. We would do well to study statistics. The chances of starting a billion dollar company in the US. The chances of earning less than $200,000 per annum in the US. The chances of needing to depend on the state for health, housing, transport or welfare over a lifetime, in the european countries. In short, a degree of financial fragility is the statistical norm; being a loser is the norm. We are far more likely to end up with a mediocre salary, with delicate health and vulnerability to ill-fortune than we are to end up robust, invulnerable winners. Yet still we insist on creating and supporting Winner Countries. Here are five of the world's top Winner Countries, countries that go out of their way to make the consequences of winning as pleasant as possible. In 5th place Brazil, in 4th place India , in 3rd palce China, in 2nd place the UK  and in 1st place the US There are a few notable loser countries on our planet. They tend not to get the limelight. Here is the list of the world's top Loser Countries: 5. The Netherlands 4. Germany 3. Switzerland 2. Norway 1. Denmark In Loser Countries, voters graciously assume that they are and will remain losers – and therefore set about trying to make their condition as pleasant as possible. They make sure there is a public transport system fit for losers: Public housing fit for losers: And public schools fit for complete losers: In these Countries for Losers, it can be awkward to be a winner. No one applauds you for driving a fancy car. Money won't buy you schools any better than the loser ones. You might even go to a loser hospital of your own accord. And your taxes might be quite high. Both Countries for Winners and Countries for Losers have their advantages. The question is whether we are voting for societies that reflect our own statistical realities. By accepting that we will almost certainly be and remain Losers, we might be sad no doubt, but we may also be liberated to scheme to live in societies that make the consequences of failing a lot less bitter.

    "Title": "Why We Eat Too Much",
    "Transcript": "It's clear that a great many of us eat too much. And in response, a huge industry has grown up which advises us to consume more quinoa, pomegranate and fennel salad and, as often as we can, kale and apple soup. But this is entirely to misunderstand why we start eating excessive amounts. It has nothing to do food, and therefore trying to change our diet isn't the most logical place to focus our efforts. We eat too much because what we're really hungry for isn't available. Of course, it looks as if everything we could want should be to hand. Our supermarkets and delis are iconic temples of consumer society. Our restaurants spare no effort trying to satisfy us. Could sir or madam be tempted by lobster thermidor? Or a selection of regional vegetables drizzled with olive oil sourced from a tiny farm in the Pyrenees? But if we could really choose anything, wouldn't we want a slightly different menu? For example: Unstressed conversation of father, marinaded in mutual forgiveness. Tenderised maternal love* (* suitable for those on a criticism-free diet). Ripe friendship served on wry banter accompanied by a side serving of affectionate teasing. Fresh conversation, liberally sprinkled with poignant anecdotes (for two). Sexual appreciation with all the trimmings (our sommelier recommends, as the ideal accompaniment, a glass of full-bodied Chateau Fantaisie). And for dessert, perhaps A generous scoop of honeyed insight. In other words, it isn't food we crave. The menus of our actual restaurants (however chic) prompt us only in very limited and restricted directions. They understand – and respond – to only a desperately narrow segment of our true appetites. Collectively, we speak so much of food, and so little of what we properly need. It isn't pizza, Spanish cheese or Argentinian steak. We need friendship where we can confess our darkest anxieties and be heard and forgiven; we need help in calming down at key moments, reassured that we can withstand the very worst that may be coming our way. We are lonely and angry within our own families and are crying out for redemption and cathartic honesty. We need someone who can help us discover our real talents in the workplace and offer us a guide to realise our true potential. We know that, when reaching for a tube of potato chips or biting into yet another burrito that the problem doesn't lie there. We just don't know where else to turn and there is, at least, a short-term satisfaction to be found. We eat too much because we hate ourselves too intensely to have the necessary respect for our own bodies. Our tragedy isn't our unconstrained appetite. But rather, the difficulty we have in getting access to the emotional and psychological things that would nourish our broken souls. The diet industry has latched onto the symptoms of our unhappiness, not their causes – and therefore the solutions it offers can only ever be temporary and fragile. It can't make us lastingly thin because it is not engaging with what made us manically fat. A couple of hundred years ago it was almost impossible for most people to find anything very pleasant to eat. Since then, a vast quantity of human ingenuity has been devoted to enticing the palate. We have succeeded beyond our wildest expectations. But in so many other areas, we have hardly begun to supply ourselves reliably with what we long to consume, which are, to put it plainly: understanding, tenderness, forgiveness, reconciliation and closeness. We eat too much not because we are (as we brutally accuse ourselves) greedy, but because we live in a world where the shelves are still bare of the real ingredients we crave. At The School Of Life we believe in developing emotional intelligence.  To that end we have also created a whole range of products to support that growth.

    "Title": "You Are Not What You Earn",
    "Transcript": "A fundamental belief of the modern world, which explains a lot of our anxiety around failure, is that we are what we earn. When we say this, we mean something very particular: not just that it's nice to have a lot of money but that our income is the source of information, crucial, decisive information, about our character, our intelligence, our moral fibre: in short, money is the key indicator of our worth in human and not just financial terms. The more money we make, the more we deserve to exist. By extension, it feels impossible to imagine ourselves as good, decent – and still poor. But can this really be true? Must we hate and deem ourselves despicable beings because our salary is not elevated? For an answer, we must look to economics and in particular, to the way that salary is determined. Here we find something striking: wages are not decided by the extent of someone's human worth or social contribution per se. Wages are simply the result of the intensity with which certain people want a job done relative to the number of people who happen to be able to do it. If many people can complete a task, however humanly important it might be (holding a hand on a cancer ward), little money will be offered for it. And if there are very few people able to do it, however trivial it might be (kicking a ball 60 metres into a goal), if there's intense demand, salaries will be elevated. Money is in fact no accurate measure of the human worth of the work in question; the determinant of wages is just the strength of demand in relation to supply. We may not be able easily to change how much people earn, but we can change how we judge earnings. This isn't an issue of politics; it's an issue of appreciation. We can change how we assess what a modest wage means. We can use our imaginations to remember and hold in mind all that is not quantified in a salary – in our lives and in those of others; all the degrees of intelligence, care, dedication, empathy and creativity that may be present, undetected by the blunt aggregated marker of a wage. However tempting it might be to settle the question of the value of humans in stark financial terms, the truth remains beautifully and redemptively more complicated – as we must realise as soon as we've spent some time around a person at work and got to know what sides of their character their labours will call on through an average day. We'll then have no option but to reach a dauntingly complex conclusion: we are not what we earn. We publish new, thought provoking, films every week.

    "Title": "What is Emotional Intelligence?",
    "Transcript": "Emotional Intelligence is the quality that enables us to confront with patience, insight and imagination the many problems that we face in our affective relationship with ourselves and with others. The term may sound odd. We are used to referring to intelligence as a general quality, without unpicking a particular variety a person might possess – and therefore we do not tend to highlight the value of a distinctive sort of intelligence which currently does not enjoy the prestige it should. Every sort of intelligence signals an ability to navigate well around a particular set of challenges: mathematical, linguistic, technical, commercial… When we say that someone is clever but add that they have made a mess of their personal lives; or that they have acquired a fortune but are restless and sad or that they are powerful but intolerant and unimaginative, we are pointing to a deficit in what deserves to be called Emotional Intelligence. In social life, we can feel the presence of Emotional Intelligence in a sensitivity to the moods of others and in a readiness to grasp the surprising things that may be going on for them beneath the surface. Emotional Intelligence recognises a role for interpretation and knows that a fiery outburst might be a disguised plea for help, that a political rant may be provoked by hunger and that concealed within a forceful jolliness may be a sorrow that has been sentimentally disavowed. In relation to ourselves, Emotional Intelligence shows up in a scepticism around our emotions, especially those of love, desire, anger, envy, anxiety and professional ambition. The Emotionally Intelligent refuse to trust their first impulses or the wisdom of their feelings. They know that hatred may mask love, that anger may be a cover for sadness and that we are prone to huge and costly inaccuracies in whom we desire and what we seek. Emotional Intelligence is also what distinguishes those who are crushed by failure from those who know how to greet the troubles of existence with a melancholy and at points darkly humorous resilience. The Emotionally Intelligent appreciate the role of well-handled pessimism within the overall economy of a good life. Emotional Intelligence isn't an inborn talent. It's the result of education, specifically in how to interpret ourselves, where our emotions arise from, how our childhoods influence us and how we might best navigate our fears and wishes. In the utopia, it would be routine to be taught Emotional Intelligence from the youngest age, before we had had the opportunity to make too many mistakes. It is because we have - until now - not taken Emotional Education seriously enough that our species has grown ever more technically adept while retaining the level of wisdom of our earliest days; with catastrophic results. We are evolved monkeys with nuclear weapons. It appears that the fate of civilisation now depends on our capacity to master the mechanisms of Emotional Education before it is too late. Emotional Education extends far beyond formal education as we have conceived of it to date. Though it should ideally include specialised courses in every year of school or college, Emotional Education is more than something that should take place in classrooms at the hands of teachers and come to a halt around the age of twenty-one. The central vehicle for the transfer of Emotional Intelligence is culture, from its highest to its most popular level. Culture is the field that can ritualise and consistently promote the absorption of wisdom. The 'lessons' of culture might be embedded in a tragedy or a TV series, a pop song or a novel, a work of architecture or a YouTube film. We can envisage the entire apparatus of culture as a subtle mechanism designed to point us towards greater emotional intelligence. We will never progress as a species, and will indeed grow into ever greater technologically-armed menaces to ourselves, until we have accepted the challenges and opportunities of properly educating our selves in Emotional Intelligence. Our Technical Intelligence is great of course.  It's led us to tame nature and conquer this planet. But a wiser, saner future for the race must depend on a capacity to master and then seductively teach the rudiments of Emotional Intelligence - while there is still time.

    "Title": "Why You Will Marry the Wrong Person",
    "Transcript": "I've been asked to talk to you today about an essay that I wrote uh for the New York Times um last year which went under a rather dramatic uh heading uh it was called why you will marry the wrong person and perhaps we can just begin um we're among friends um by just asking how many of you in the room do feel on balance that you have married the wrong person I mean we're among friends honest any yeah lady that c couple of people that 5 10 I'd say 30 people in the room and and so we always have to trle that uh so there's there's a pretty hefty majority but I'm here to give counsel and to give uh consolation for this situation you know there's a lot of anger around our love lives privately held but a lot of us go around feeling quite enraged angry privately about the way that our love lives have gone my task today is to turn that anger into sadness if we if we manage to turn rage into grief we will have made psychological progress and this is uh the task today what lies behind rage very often is an unusual quality because we tend to think that very angry people are sort of dark and pessimistic characters absolutely not scratch the surface of any regularly angry person and you will find a wild Optimist it is in fact hope that drives rage think of the person who screams every time they can't find their house keys or every time they get stuck in traffic these unfortunate characters are evincing a curious but Reckless faith in a world in which Keys Never Go astray the roads are mysteriously traffic free it is hope that is turbocharging their rage so if we're to get a little bit less sad uh uh and as a little less angry about our love lives we will have to diminish some of our hopes it's very hard to diminish hope around love because there are vast Industries designed to inflate our expectations of Love um there was wonderful quote from the German philosopher Theodore adoro who in the 1960s said that the most dangerous man in America was Walt Disney and the reason for his attack on Walt was because he believed that Walt was the Prime agent of Hope and therefore of rage and therefore of bitterness and he thought that um it was the task of philosophy to let us down uh gently which is what I'm going to be uh uh doing uh today so remember the theme of the talk why you will marry the wrong person there are a number of reasons why this is going to happen to you or has maybe already in the privacy of your heart happened to you um I should say that it's not that bad and the reason is that all of us uh will not manage to find the right person but we will probably all of us manage to find a good enough person so and that's success um as as as you will we'll come see one of the one of the reasons why we're not going to be able to pull this one off as successfully as we might have hoped at the early at the outset of our our probably our teenage Hood when we were contemplating love is that we are very strange I'm very strange and you're very strange you don't let on and you know we're not going to do anything very dangerous but we are basically psychologically quite strange um we don't normally know very much about this strangeness it takes us a long long time before we're really on top of the way in which we are hard to live with does anyone in this room think that they're quite easy to live with on balance yeah oh my goodness okay I don't want to be rude but please come and see me afterwards I know I know that you're not easy to live with um and the reason is that you are Homo sapiens and therefore you are not easy to live with no one is um and but there's a there's a wall of Silence that surrounds us from a deeper acquaintance with what is actually so difficult about us uh our friends don't want to tell us why would they bother they just want a pleasant evening out they're not our friends know more about us us and more about our flaws probably after a 10-minute acquaintance a stranger will know more about your flaws than you might learn over 40 years of life on the planet our our capacity to Intuit it what is wrong with us is very weak our parents don't tell us very much why would they they love us too much they know they can see of course I mean they've followed us from the crib they know what's wrong with us they're not going to tell us uh because they they just want to you know be sweet uh and our ex-lovers a vital source of knowledge they know absolutely they know uh but do you remember that speech that they gave it was it was moving at the time when they said that they wanted a little more space and we're attracted to travel and we're interested in the culture of Southeast Asia nonsense they thought lots of things were wrong with you but they weren't going to be bothered to tell you they were just off out of there why would they bother so this knowledge that is out there is not in you it's out there but it's not in you and so therefore we progress through the world with a very uh low sense of what is actually wrong with us um not least all of us are addicts almost all of us are addicts not injecting heroin as such but addicts in the we need to redefine what addiction is I like to Define addiction not in terms of the substance you're taking in other words you know I'm heroin addict I'm a cocaine addict no addiction is basically any pattern of behavior whereby you cannot stand to be with yourself and certain of the more uncomfortable thoughts and more importantly emotions that come from being on your own and so therefore you can be addicted to almost anything so long as it keeps you away from yourself so long as it keeps you away from tricky self- knowledge and most of us are addicts and thanks to all sorts of Technologies and uh distractions Etc we can have a good life where we will almost certainly be guaranteed not to spend any time with ourselves um except maybe for certain kind of airlines that still don't have the gadgets to distract us but otherwise you can be guaranteed you don't have to talk to yourself and this is a disaster for your capacity to have a relationship with another person because until you know yourself you can't properly relate uh to another person um one of the reasons why love is so tricky for us is that it requires us to do something we really don't want to do which is to approach another human being and say I need you I wouldn't really survive without you I am vulnerable before you and there's a very strong impulse in all of us to be strong and to be well- defended and not to reveal our vulnerability to another person psycho psychologists talk of two patterns of response that tend to crop up in people whenever there's a danger of needing to be extremely vulnerable dangerously vulnerable and exposed to another person the first response is to get what what um uh psychologists call anxiously attached this attachment Theory some of you may know so when you are anxiously attached to somebody rather than saying I need you I depend on you you start to get very procedural you say you're 10 minutes late or I think the bin bags need to be taken out or you start to get strict when actually what you want to do is to ask a very poignant question do you still care about me but we don't dare to ask that question so instead we get nasty we get stiff uh we get procedural the other other thing the other pattern of behavior which psychologists have identified and it tends to apply to people uh who are in this room in other words a types very outgoing types uh Strivers uh you become in relationships tell me if I'm wrong uh you become what is known as avoidant which means that when you when you need someone it's precisely at that moment that you pretend you don't when you feel most vulnerable you say I'm quite busy at the moment I'm fine thanks I'm well busy today uh in other words you don't reveal the need for another person which sets them off in into a chain of wondering whether uh you are to be trusted and there's then a cycle of low trust so we get into these patterns of not daring to do the thing that we really need to do which is to say even though I'm a grown person maybe I've got a beard maybe I've been alive for a long time uh I'm 6'2 Etc I'm actually a small child inside and I need you I like a small child would need its parent this is so humbling that most of us refuse to make that step and therefore refuse the challenge of uh of Love um in short we don't know very very much how to love we and it sounds very odd cuz imagine if somebody said to you look all of us probably in this room would probably need to go to a school of love we think what a school of love love is just an instinct no it's not it's a skill and it's a skill that needs to be learned and it's a skill that our society refuses to consider as a skill we are meant to always just follow our feelings if you keep following your feelings you will almost certainly make a big mistake uh in in your life what is love ultimately love I believe is something first of all there's a distinction between love loving and being loved we all start off in life by knowing a lot about being loved being loved is the fun bit uh that's when somebody brings you something on a tray and ask you how your day at school went Etc and we grow up thinking that that is what's going to happen in an adult relationship we can be forgiven for that it's an understandable mistake but it's a very tragic mistake and it leads us not to pay attention to the other side of the equation which is to love and what does it really mean to love to love ultimately is to have the willingness to interpret someone's on the surface not not very appealing behavior in order to find more benevolent reasons why it may be unfolding in other words to love someone is to apply charity and generosity of interpretation most of us are in dire need of love because actually we need to be we need to have some slack cut for us because our behavior is often so tricky that if we don't do this uh we wouldn't get through uh any kind of relationship but we're not used to thinking that that is the at the core of what love is core of what love is is the willingness to interpret another's behavior um what we tend to be very bad at is recognizing that anyone that we can love is going to be a perplexing mixture of the good and the bad there's a wonderful uh psychoanalyst called Melanie Klein who was active in the 50s and 60s originally from Vienna uh active in North London studying how children learned about relationships from the parental situation and she came up with a very fascinating analysis she argued that when children are small very small they don't really realize that a parent is one character they actually do what she called split a parent into a good parent and a bad parent and so this is when a a baby is you know really at infant stage so what you do is you split into the good mother or and the bad mother and it takes a long long time melan Klein thought it might be until you're four um until you actually realize that the good and the bad mother are one person and you become ambivalent in other words you become able to hate someone and really go off them and at the same time also love them and you're able not to run away from that situation you're able to say I love someone and hate them and that's okay uh and Melanie Klein thought this is an immense psychological achievement when we can no longer merely divide people into absolutely brilliant perfect what marvelous and hateful let me down disappointed me everyone who we love is going to disappoint us we start off with idealization and we end up often with denigration the person goes from being absolutely marvelous to being absolutely terrible maturity is the ability to see that there are no heroes or or Sinners really among human beings that all of us have this wonderfully perplexing mixture of the good and the bad and adulthood true psychological maturity and you may need to be 65 before it hits you I'm not there yet uh is the capacity to realize that anyone that you love is going to be this mixture of uh uh the good and the bad so love is not just admiration for strength it is also tolerance for weakness and recognition of ambivalence um the reason why we're going to probably make some real mistakes when we choose our love Partners some of you in this room have made some stunning mistakes now why is this the reason is that we've been told that the way to find a good partner is to follow your instinct right follow your heart that's the Mantra and so we're all the time reminded that if we stop uh reasoning analyzing by the way are there people in this room who think that you can think too much about your emotions there sort of few people go you you can think too much a few people okay I you can't think too much you can only ever think badly uh but there's no such thing as thinking too much about emotions but the problem is we live in a romantic culture that privileges impulse now when it comes to love something tricky occurs because you don't have to be a paid out believer in Psychotherapy or psychoanalysis to realize that the way we love as adults sits on top of our early childhood experien and in early childhood the way that we learned about love was not just via experiences of tenderness and kindness and generosity the love that we will have tasted as children will also be bound up with experiences of being let down being humiliated maybe being with a parent who treated us very harshly who scolded us who made us feel small in some way in other words quite a lot about our early experiences of Love abound up with various kinds of suffering now something quite bad happens when we start to go out into the adult world and start to choose love Partners we think we're out to find Partners who will make us happy but we're not we're out to find Partners who will feel familiar and that may be a very different thing because familiarity may be bound up with particular kinds of torture and this explains why sometimes um people will say to us look there's a wonderful person you should go and date them they're they're they're goodlooking they're Charming they're all sorts of things and we go out with them we them and we do recognize that they're really wonderful and amazing but we have to confess to our partners that to to our friends that actually we found this person often we struggle with the vocabulary we say maybe not that exciting or maybe not sexy or a bit boring but really what we mean is that we've detected in this really quite accomplished person someone who will not be able to make us suffer in the way that we need to suffer in order to feel that love is real and that's why we we reject them so we are not merely on a quest to be happy we are on a quest to suffer in ways that feel familiar and this radically undermines our capacity to find a good partner here's another reason why we're going to come unstuck in the field of Love We tend to believe that the more a lover is right for us the less we're going to have to explain about who we are how we feel what upsets us what we want we believe rather as a young child believe of its parent that a true lover will guess what is in our minds one of the great errors that human beings make is permanently to feel that other people know what's in their minds without us having said what's in our minds it's very cumbersome to use words it's such a bore and when it comes to love we have this deep desire that will simply be understood wordlessly it's touching it's a beautiful romantic idea but it also leads to a catastrophic outbreak of sulking now what is sulking sulking is an interesting phenomenon we don't just sulk with anyone we sulk with people who we feel should understand us and yet for some reason have decided not to and that's why we tend to reserve our suks for people who we love and who we think love us and they tell us something you know they unwittingly will trigger a negative reaction in us and we'll Suk and they'll say what's wrong with you darling and we'll say nothing and they'll say but come on you're upset and we'll go no I'm not I'm absolutely fine and it's not true and we'll go upstairs and we'll shut the door and we won't tell them what's wrong with us and then they'll knock at the door and they say please just tell me and we'll say no because we want them to read our souls because we expect that a true lover can understand what we feel and who we are without us speaking this is a catastrophe for our capacity to form lasting relationships if you do not explain you can never be understood the root to a good marriage and to Good Love is the ability to become a good teacher now teaching sounds like a narrow profession those guys in Tweed jackets and fussy with a with a chalkboard Etc I'm not talking about that kind of teaching all of us whatever our job aspirations whatever it is we do have to become teachers now teaching is merely the word that we give to the skill of getting an idea from one head into another in a way that is likely to be accepted and most of us are appalling teachers most of us teach when we're tired when we're frightened what are we frightened of we're frightened we've married an idiot and because we're so frightened we start screaming at them you've got to understand and the thing is that unfortunately by the time you've started to humiliate the person you want to understand something less and over you will never get anyone to understand what you want them to understand so long as you make them feel small in order to teach well you need to be relaxed you need to accept that maybe your partner won't understand um and also you need a culture within a couple that two people are going to need to teach each other and therefore also learn from one another and this brings me to the next reason why you're going to have a very unhappy relationship probably and that is because you probably believe that when somebody tries to tell you something about yourself that's a little ticklish and a little uncomfortable they are attacking you they're not they're trying to make you into a better person and we don't tend to believe that this has a role in love we tend to believe that true love means accepting the whole of us it doesn't no one should accept the whole of us we're appalling really want the whole of you accepted no that's not love the the full display of our characters the full articulation of who we are should not be something that we do in front of anyone that we care about um so what we need to do uh is is to accept that the other person is going to want to educate us and that it isn't a criticism criticism is merely the wrong word that we apply to a much nobler idea which is to try and make us into better versions of ourselves but we tend to reject this idea uh very strongly um is there any hope of course there's hope look I mentioned the word good enough it's a phrase phase taken from a wonderful English psychoanalyst called Donald winot he had a lot of parents who would come to him and say things like I'm so worried I'm not a good parent um my child has this problem or that problem Etc and he came up with a wonderful phrase he said you are most likely to be a good enough parent and he it's a relief from our otherwise punishing uh uh perfectionism the good thing is that none of us are perfect and therefore we don't need Perfection and the demand for Perfection will lead you to only one thing loneliness you cannot have Perfection and Company to be in company with another person is to be negotiating imperfection every day um incompatibility we are all incompatible but it is the work of love to make us graciously accommodate each other and ourselves to each other's incompatibilities uh and and therefore compatibility is an achievement of love it isn't what you need from the outset of course you're not going to be totally compatible that's not the point it is through love that you grow gradually accept the need uh uh to to be uh compatible um we probably can't change our types right so all of us are pro many of us are have got types who are going to cause us real problems they may be too distant they may be arrogant they're going to torture Us in some way now friends casually say to us Chuck them get out the relationship Etc right no I don't you know we're realists here at Google and I'm giving you realistic advice you're not going to manage to change your type let's get that for granted what you can do and this is a big achievement is to change how you characteristically respond to your tricky type most of us have formed the way that we respond to tricky types in early childhood so we had a distant parent we've now chosen a Distant Lover when we were very young we responded to that distant parent by attention seeking we rattled and banged and now we're adults we rattle and bang in our own way and we think that's going to help it doesn't it creates a a cycle that's going to be a vicious uh uh cycle that's not going to get us anywhere it is open to us at any time to have a more mature response to the challenges that the types of people we're attracted to are going to pose for us and that is an immense step forward an immense uh uh achievement um the other thing we should do is recognize the nobility of compromise one of the most shameful things to ever have to admit is to say this is my partner I've compromised in choosing them I've compromised oh why have you compromised well I'm not that attractive myself uh I've got lots of problems I'm a bit nutty frankly I couldn't pull anyone better but they're very nice they're okay now you would think loser it's not true compromise is Noble we compromise in every area of life there's no reason why we shouldn't compromise in our love lives maybe we're sticking around for the children good people say oh they're only sticking around for the children that's a wonderful reason to stick around why else are you going to stick around okay so let's look a bit more benevolently at the art of uh compromise it's a massive achievement uh in love I'm going to end um with with a a quote from one of my favorite philosophers Danish 19th century very gloomy philosopher called kard and kard in his book either or had a wonderful Outburst where he basically said of course you're going to marry the wrong person and make the wrong decisions in a whole row of areas and the reason you're going to do this is that you're human therefore do not berate yourself for doing what humans do this is what he says marry and you will regret it don't marry you will also regret it marry or don't marry you will regret it either way laugh at the world's foolishness you'll regret it weep over it you'll regret that too laugh at the world's foolishness or weep over it you will regret both hang yourself you will regret it don't hang yourself you will regret that too hang yourself or don't hang yourself you'll regret it either way whether you hang yourself or don't hang yourself you will regret both this gentleman is the essence of all philosophy thank you very [Applause] [Music] much we publish new

    "Title": "How To Be A Genius",
    "Transcript": "We hear a lot about genius. We are taught to admire the minds of those infinite, baffling but astonishing geniuses like Einstein, Tolstoy or Picasso. Quite what genius might actually be is left a little vague. It's a codeword for 'brilliant but perhaps too other-worldly ever really to fathom.' We are invited to stand in awe at the achievements of geniuses but also to feel that their thought processes might be quasi-magical and that it is ultimately simply mysterious how they were ever able to come up with the ideas they have had. But there is a radically different view, suggested by a hugely prescient quote from the 19th century American genius Ralph Waldo Emerson: In the minds of geniuses, we find – once more – our own neglected thoughts. What this tells us is that the genius doesn't have different kinds of thoughts from the rest of us. They simply take them more seriously. We ourselves will often have had our own sketchy, hesitant version of their ideas – which is why their works can have such a distinctive impression on us. What they present feels surprising and impressive, of course; yet also obvious and right – once it has been pointed out. They are giving clear and powerful articulation to notions that are already familiar because we've been circling them ourselves, possibly for years, without quite ever being able to close in on them properly. Genius can in this sense be defined as paying closer attention to our real thoughts and feelings and being brave and tenacious enough to hold onto them even when they find no immediate echo in the world beyond. The reason why we disavow so much of what passes through our minds is in essence anxiety. We kill off our most promising thoughts for fear of seeming strange to ourselves and others (which explains why small children are, in their own way, so much more interesting than the average adult: they have not yet become experts in what not to say or think). But when we censor and close down, when we take fright and try not to think, is exactly the moment when the so-called genius starts to take note of what is happening within their mind. We operate with a false picture of genius when we identify it too strongly with what is exotic and utterly beyond us. It is something far more provocative than this. Genius is what we all can be when we pay careful attention to what is truly passing through consciousness. We all have very similar and very able minds; where geniuses differ is in their more robust inclinations to study them properly. We love bringing you these films.

    "Transcript": "It can be so hard to forgive because – so often – we simply are in the right and the scale of the folly, thoughtlessness and meanness of others seems utterly beyond our own measure. But there are two inviolable ideas which should nevertheless, in the face of the grossest behavior, be kept in mind to increase our chances of being able to forgive. Firstly: we must remember how the other person got there, to this place of idiocy and cruelty. Every irritating fault in another person has a long history behind it. They have become like this because of flaws in their development, which they did not choose for themselves. They were shaped by troubles which we cannot see but which we can know exist. The arrogant person was trapped (at some key point in their personal evolution) in an environment where being modest and reasonable seemed to guarantee they'd be trampled on. The hyper-critical individual has lived too much, as their personality was growing, around people who couldn't take a gentle hint – so they came to rely on blunt assertions. The frustratingly timid, mousy person was (at some stage) terrified; the show-off learned their irritating manner around people who were hard to please. Behind every failing – behind everything that's wrong and infuriating about those we meet – is a decisive trauma encountered before someone could cope with it properly. They are maddening but they got to be this way without meaning to. To forgive is to understand the origins of evil and cruelty. Secondly, and very strangely, there are difficult things about you too. Of course, not in this area. Not in any area remotely connected to the sort of lapses that destroy your faith in humanity. But in some areas, quiet areas that you forget about as soon as you've travelled through them, you too are a deeply imperfect and questionable individual. Gently, you have – in your own way – betrayed. Nicely, you have been a coward. Modestly, you have forgotten your privileges. Unthinkingly, you have added salt to the wounds of others. We don't need to know anything about you to know this as a certainty. We must forgive because – not right now, not over this, but one day, over something – we need to be forgiven. We would – in the past – regularly have looked up to the heavens for this forgiveness. We do that less and less. But that doesn't attenuate the need for some moments when we limber up to utter that most implausible word 'sorry' – or indeed stretch our ethical imagination in order to pronounce those even more arduous and unnatural words, 'I forgive you.

    "Title": "Why We Are All Addicts",
    "Transcript": "We operate with some stock images of the addict: a person with a heroin needle in a park, or who nurses a bottle of gin in a paper bag at nine in the morning or who sneaks off at every opportunity to light up another cylinder of marijuana. However dramatic and tragic such cases of addiction might be, they are simultaneously hugely reassuring to most of us – because they locate the addict far from ordinary experience, somewhere off-stage, in the land of semi-criminality and outright breakdown. Such examples are dangerously flattering, categorising addiction in a sentimental way that lets most of us off the hook – and at the same time, cuts us off from identification with, and therefore sympathy for, the most wretched victims of addiction. There are, in truth, far more addicts than we think. Indeed, if we look at the matter squarely: we are pretty much all addicts. The official statistics on the consumption of hard drugs or alcohol don't begin to give a fair representation of the issue. We need to define addiction in a new way: addiction is the manic reliance on something, anything, in order to keep our dark or unsettling thoughts at bay. What properly indicates addiction is not what someone is addicted to, for we can get addicted to pretty much anything. It is the motives behind their reliance on it – and, in particular, their desire to avoid encountering the contents of their own mind. Being inside our own minds is, for most of us, and very understandably, a deeply anxiety-inducing prospect. We are filled with thoughts we don't want properly to entertain and feelings we are desperate not to feel. There is an infinite amount we are angry and sad about that it would take an uncommon degree of courage to face. We experience a host of fantasies and desires that we have a huge incentive to disavow, because of the extent to which they violate our self-image and our more normative commitments. We shouldn't pride ourselves because we aren't injecting something into our veins. Almost certainly, we are doing something with equal commitment. We are checking the news at four minute intervals, to keep the news from ourselves at bay. We're doing sport, exhausting our bodies in the hope of not having to hear from our minds. We're using work to get away from the true internal work we're shirking. The most compelling addictions sound very righteous to the world. To get a measure of our levels of addiction, we need only consider when the last time might have been that we were able to sit alone in a room with our own thoughts, without distraction, free associating, daring to wander into the past and the future, allowing ourselves to feel pain, desire, regret and excitement. We may start to see how much we have in common with the traditional addict. When we come face to face with them, we're not meeting anything especially foreign, just a part of ourselves in a less respectable form – opening up new opportunities for kindness, towards them, and us. We could start to think, too, of how we might wean ourselves off our chosen addictive pursuit. We need to lose our fear of our minds. We need a collective sense of safety around confronting loss, humiliation, sexual desire and sadness – knowing that we will have to keep running so long as we do not rehabilitate our feelings. On the other side of addiction is, in a sense, philosophy – understood as the patient, unfrightened, compassionate examination of the contents of our own minds.

    "Title": "The Cure for Unrequited Love",
    "Transcript": "For intense periods of our lives, we suffer the agony of unrequited love. Our sorrow is accompanied by a certainty that if only the elusive being would return our smiles, come for dinner or marry us, we would know bliss. Epochal happiness seems tantalisingly close, wholly real and yet maddeningly out of reach. At such moments, we are often counselled to try to forget the beloved. We should – given their lack of interest – try to think of something or someone else. Yet this kindness is deeply misguided. The cure for love does not lie in ceasing to think of the fugitive lover, but in learning to think more intensely and constructively about who they might really be. From close up, every human who has ever lived proves deeply challenging. We are all – at close quarters – trying propositions. We are short-tempered, vain, deceitful, crass, sentimental, woolly, cold, over-emotional and chaotic. What prevents us from holding this in mind in relation to certain people is simply a lack of knowledge. We assume – on the basis of a few charming outside details – that the target of our passion may miraculously have escaped the fundamentals of the human condition. They haven't. We just haven't got to know them properly. This is what makes unrequited love so intense, so long-lasting and so vicious. By preventing us from properly growing close to them, the beloved also prevents us from tiring of them in the cathartic and liberating manner that is the gift of requited love. It isn't their charms that are keeping us magnetised; it is our lack of knowledge of their flaws. The cure for unrequited love is, in structure, therefore very simple. We must get to know them better. The more we discovered of them, the less they would ever look like the solution to all our problems. We would discover the endless small ways in which they were irksome; we'd get to know how stubborn; how critical; how cold and how hurt by things that strike us as meaningless they could be. That is, if we got to know them better, we'd realise how much they had in common with everyone else. Passion can never withstand too much exposure to the full reality of another person. The unbounded admiration on which it is founded is destroyed by the knowledge which a properly shared life inevitably brings. The cruelty of unrequited love isn't really that we haven't been loved back, rather it's that our hopes have been aroused by someone who can never disappoint us, someone who we will have to keep believing in because we lack the knowledge that would set us free. We must, in the absence of a direct cure, undertake an imaginative one. We must accept, without quite knowing the details, that they would, of course, eventually prove decisively irritating. Everyone does. We have to believe this not because we know it exactly of them, but because they are – in the end – human and we know this dark but deeply cheering fact about everyone who has ever lived.

    "Title": "Why We Only Learn When We Repeat",
    "Transcript": "One of the most obvious but striking things about a modern education is that you go through it only once. You show up every day for a number of years, get filled up with knowledge and then, once you're twenty-one or so, you stop – and begin the rest of your life. Before modern education took off, the mightiest educational systems in the world were religions. It was religions that taught us about ethics, purpose and the meaning of life. And one of the interesting aspects of their pedagogy was that they were obsessed with repetition. For them, it was absurd to imagine ever learning anything if you went through it only once. The whole basis of religious education rested upon repetition. Five times a day, as a Muslim one was to rehearse the central tenets of Islam; seven times a day as a Christian Benedictine monk, one was to revisit the lessons of scripture. As an orthodox Jew, 300 days a year were marked out for commemoration and ritual repetition of ideas in the Torah, while as a Zen priest, one would be inducted to sit cross-legged and meditate up to twelve times between daybreak and nightfall. Religions had what one might term a sieve view of the mind: that anything one pours in will quickly be lost in our perforated memories. By contrast, modern education adheres to an implicitly bucket-like theory of the mind: one pours in the contents and, bar accidents, they'll stay there pretty much across a life-time. That's why we'll think nothing of earnestly declaring a book a favourite – and deigning to read it only once. Far less naively and far more generously, religions prefer to imagine that anything you tell someone in the morning will, by two in the afternoon, be well on the way to evaporation and will be pretty much gone by nightfall. Repetition is the only way of ensuring that something will stick. Once you've finished reading a favourite holy text, the story of Moses for example, you head straight back to the beginning and start again, with the bull rushes and the baby infant. We pay a heavy price for our lack of interest in rehearsing lessons and ideas. There are all kinds of things we badly need to keep in our minds: the better parts of our nature that speak to us of being patient, of remaining gentle, of striving for forgiveness, of pausing to appreciate, of straining to understand what at first seems unbearably foreign… We've been taught these things once, of course. But it was a while ago now. Possibly when we were seven. And so, naturally, they're not at the front of our minds as we career through our lives, smashing into things and people, raging and blaming, slandering and hating. There's equal, and possibly far greater wisdom to be found in the secular as opposed to the religious sphere, but those who dispense it are far too hopeful about the functioning of our minds. They choose to tell us just once, possibly in quite a low voice, about all the things that matter; maybe in a beautiful but very dense poem or in quite a slow moving novel we once read fitfully over a summer two decades ago. And then they expect us to keep it all in mind our whole lives long – and we're surprised that the march of human craziness goes on unabated. We should not abandon our most precious insights to the lax guardians of our memories. We need to steal the idea of repetition from religions – and create our own catechisms, our own midnight prayers, our own cycles of rehearsed knowledge. We need to make the most important ideas vivid in our minds on a constant basis. We should never be done with school. We should daily be re-immersed in the great truths: that we will die, that we must understand ourselves, that we must love, that others are sad rather than mean… Many of us are done with religion; but we shouldn't be done with what religions knew so well of our minds: that nothing stays active in them, unless we rehearse and repeat with every new dawn. We need to keep coming back – Not least: here. At The School Of Life we believe in developing emotional intelligence. To that end we have also created a whole range of products to support that growth. Find out more at the link on the screen now."

    "Title": "The Problem With Perfectionism",
    "Transcript": "Perfectionism is the unreasonable and self-defeating ambition of getting something absolutely right – which makes us difficult to be around and punishing to live within. The origins of perfectionism lie in the imagination, in the ease with which we can conjure up a picture of an ideal state of affairs, compared with the monstrous difficulty of bringing such a state into being by ourselves. The sickness of perfectionism gestates in the fertile gap between our noble visions and our mediocre reality. And yet our problems do not ultimately arise in our love of perfection per se. They lie in our reckless tendencies to under-budget for the difficulties of achieving it. The proper target for (gentle) criticism is premature perfectionism. How accurately we budget – for time and effort – is dependent on a proper grasp of the inherent difficulty of any task. If we fully recognise something to be exceptionally arduous, we don't panic when our first efforts are weak and progress slow. It's difficult – but we knew it would be. High standards only become a problem when we think something might and should be substantially easier than it turns out to be, and when we read our struggles as marks of our own ineptitude rather than as an inevitable part of an entirely legitimate lengthy journey. Perfectionism is only a problem because we have underbudgeted for difficulty, not because we are aiming high. It strikes when we imagine we might write a good novel in six months, or have a good career by the age of thirty or have worked out spontaneously how to have a successful marriage. Our perfectionism starts to torture us when we lack information on how hard others had to work and how much they had suffer before reaching their ideas of perfection. In a better world culture would endlessly draw to our attention the first drafts, and hidden labours of others, and properly alert us to the true horrors exacted by anything worth doing. We would not then be impatient sickly perfectionists, we would be patient resilient questers for excellence. The problem isn't that we're aiming for perfection. It's that we don't have an accurately redemptive idea of what perfection really demands. At The School Of Life we believe in developing emotional intelligence, To that end we have also created a whole range of products to support that growth. Find out more at the link on the screen now."

    "Title": "What to Do About Being Clumsy",
    "Transcript": "Our own clumsiness can feel like one of the most shameful things about us. On returning a carton to the fridge, we trip and spill orange juice down our whole front. It goes into our shoes, too. Even the inside lining of the soles are soaked in orange pulp. It's a good ten minutes and a few towels before we've changed out of all our clothes - even our underwear - and cleaned ourselves up. We feel three and a half years old. When are we gonna grow up into the adults we supposedly are? If only this were the only such incident, but clumsiness may stalk us everywhere. A month ago we badly bruised our knee against a door, then we spilled blueberries over the kitchen floor, and recently we went around for a whole day not noticing there was a piece of lettuce coating one of our teeth. We're furious with, and ashamed of ourselves. Our clumsiness violates our self-image as competent grownups. There's a Yiddish word that artfully evokes the extent of our stupidity. The clumsy person is in Yiddish a klutz, a dunderhead, a blockhead, a fool It's the inner klutz who makes us drop plates, who walks into doors and who didn't remember to do up its flies. It's normal to hate our klutz and with a grim face to try to deny it's even really there inside us. Instead, we strive to hold on to our dignity and when we can presume that the klutz has gone away for good. When we do meet with it, it's always with some horror, agitation and humiliation - we thought we'd left the Klutz behind, somewhere in childhood. But no, it's still here, getting us to drop our phone in the toilet bowl and forget an important person's name at a party. But there would be another less explored option: to make friends with our inner Klutz Not to keep denying that it really exists, but to face up to it head-on, in good time. We should accept without rancor or fury that we simply are at one level Klutzes who knock things over, spill drinks and make fools of ourselves in small and large ways. This is only a humiliation if we insist that the only way to be acceptable is to exhibit constant competence. Once we accept that we are klutzes through and through, one more spilled drink won't need to discomfort us much further. What particularly humiliates us at moments of clumsiness is the impression that we're all alone with our ineptness. We wouldn't mind being clumsy if everyone was clumsy, too. But they don't seem to be. We appear to have been singled out as the greatest klutzes we've ever met! Far from it. We simply don't see the clumsiness of other people as we do our own, because it happens in private and is carefully edited out of public life. It's not surprising that in comedy shows there is such a widespread appetite for watching people fall off their bikes or walk into lampposts. We feel so relieved by evidence that clumsiness is not ours alone. It may look as if we're mocking but really we're delighted to have found people as absurd as we are. The comedy show invites us to see our own clumsiness as part of a collective foolishness, not a private tragedy. We can also see that our own clumsiness is not what sets us apart from others, but actually what we share in secret with everyone We can accommodate our idiocy more sweetly inside ourselves by trusting at last that it is entirely normal and universal to be clumsy, that it's a factor to be understood and forgiven in ourselves because it should be understood and forgiven in everyone. The next time we spill something down our front, we shouldn't feel a hot prickly rage. We should greet our inner klutz like an old familiar friend with a warm, tolerant smile of recognition.

    "Title": "How to Recount Your Dreams",
    "Transcript": "It's been a dramatic night: you were in a hotel at a crossroads; the tide was coming in; someone threw a pencil at you; you were in the back of a big car with your grandmother, on the way to sit an exam; you had to climb over a wall but kept being tickled by a giant squirrel. Then you woke up. It felt immensely important, but when you go downstairs and try to tell your companions about the extraordinary things that travelled through your sleeping brain, the results are sobering. You keep saying that it felt 'exciting', 'so weird' and 'absolutely amazing', but – strangely – your attempts to get others to experience the particularities of your night are met by some dispiritingly blank stares. Half-way through the narration, someone pipes up to say the cereal is running low. Another person mentions it might rain later. Then the doorbell rings. It's a poignant impasse, but not an untypical one either. It's tempting to think the problem has to do with dreams themselves – because they are so odd, unique and specific to us. But the difficulty isn't limited to dreams: it's a general problem of existence, which can just as well strike when we try to explain how our holiday was, what we feel about our childhood or our ideas about how society should be run. Much about our lives is like a very intensely-felt dream we can't quite get others to listen to properly. The reason is to a striking extent down to a collective lack of preparation, an insufficient sense that what we're trying to do is really very hard and therefore will require a high degree of skill and practice. We naively assume that enthusiasm and authenticity can be enough; and that if we feel something to be important or beautiful, it will inevitably and immediately strike others as being so as well. This charming, though ultimately lonely, egocentricity can be best seen in children who are among the worst story tellers, because they have a touchingly weak hold on a very painful idea: that other people are liable to be in different places from us internally and are highly unlikely to understand, feel and see as we do unless we go to considerable lengths to extract, arrange and systematically package up the contents of our minds for them. These are some of the rules for storytelling: – firstly, we know what we mean far earlier than anyone else can and so we must understand a story at least five times as well when it is to be shared in company as when it is merely left to marinade in our own brains. – secondly, keeping a story brief takes far more effort than letting it expand. The philosopher Pascal once touchingly apologised to a friend for the length of a letter he had written him. As he admitted: 'I'm sorry I didn't have time to make it shorter.' – thirdly, we need to simplify. The downfall of almost all anecdotes is an accumulation of incidental detail untethered to the underlying logic of the story. If one is explaining how it felt to see one's grandmother, it is irrelevant (and a waste of someone else's rather precious life) to say what time one left the house and what the weather happened to be like. We need a view of the branches, not of every leaf. – fourthly, factual events (dates, times, actions) are always less interesting (though far easier to remember) than feelings – and yet it's the feelings that invariably contain the kernel of what can intrigue others. It's how we feel about what happened, not merely what happened, that counts. Most of what comes out of our mouths is more or less unsocialised, in the sense of not quite fit for the consumption of the world and a legacy of environments that sentimentally set the bar of successful communication far too low. Those who grow up to speak clearly are those especially alive to the risk and the tragedy of being misunderstood. The contents of our minds, and even of our dreams, are never really too strange or boring for others to understand: it's just that our culture hasn't yet taken seriously enough the bracing challenges of narrating the real substance of our complex days and nights to other people.

    "Transcript": "John Maynard Keynes was a political economist of extraordinary optimism and vision who believed that governments have it in their power to solve some of the greatest ills of capitalism. Keynes refused either to believe in communism, or in the utter wisdom of the unfettered free market. Instead, he occupied a middle course, believing that governments could, with a judicious injection of money here and a rise regulation there, smooth out the peaks and troughs to which all economies seem fatefully prone. Keynes believed that what chiefly holds back countries is corruption, knee-jerk policies, and shortsightedness, but that if these three ills are corrected, then humanity can look forward to an age of incredible and lasting wealth. In a charming essay titled, \"Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,\" written in 1930, at the height of the world economic crisis, Keynes outlined his belief that most severe economic problems could be overcome, and give way to an age where the chief challenge for human beings would be how to occupy their leisure time in conditions of mass prosperity. For Keynes, economics was not a dull science. It was the tool with which to bring about economic security for all. Keynes' background was well-to-do, and throughout his life, he remained firmly a part of the British establishment. Educated at Eton and at Cambridge University, Keynes was unusual for the breadth of his artistic and literary interests. Throughout his life, he maintained friendships with some of the most brilliant artists and scholars of the twentieth century, and was an integral part of the Bloomsbury Group of writers and intellectuals. Virginia Woolf, for example, was one of his best friends. As the Bloomsbury Group recognized, good economics is as fundamental to wellbeing as good painting or literature, and at a deep sense, not fundamentally different in its search for the wellsprings of fulfilment, and its attention to human error and blindness. Keynes' masterpiece was written in 1936. The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money. In this work, Keynes set out to rethink the causes of unemployment, in the hope of reducing new solutions to this intractable problem of the 1930s, and of capitalism more generally. Classical economics give us three reasons why unemployment exists. Firstly, and most obviously, workers are temporarily unemployed when they move jobs. Secondly, individuals might simply elect not to work, particularly if they can support themselves through some form of welfare payment. But thirdly, and most interestingly, unemployment arises when wages are higher than what employers can afford. In the classical model, it's assumed that a free market will correct this last course automatically, and that the supply of labor and the demand for labor will spontaneously come into equilibrium. ensuring something approaching full employment. Only, if some outside force were to exert itself on the market--for example, if governments set a minimum wage that artificially inflates wages, or if trade unions organized workers so that they refused to take lower wages in a declining market, only under these conditions would equilibrium not be found. But Keynes took issue with this classical theory. In the 1930s, there were huge numbers of people out of work, as many as 3 million in Britain and 15 million in the United States of America. These numbers were just too great to shrug off as the result of people being between jobs or simply idle. And to Keynes' way of thinking, this level of unemployment was also too great to be explained by the interference of trade unions, given that, during the years of the Great Depression, high unemployment had severely curbed union power. For Keynes, the real problem of unemployment lay in a lack of demand. This was not something that economists had ever properly focused on, but it became the linchpin of Keynes' theories. Classical economic theory had simply assumed that demand for goods would return by itself once wages and labor requirements had equalized. But Keynes now famously declared, \"In the long run, we are all dead.\" In other words, this process might simply take too long. Keynes argued that it was insufficient for economists and policymakers simply to advise people to accept suffering in the short and medium term, secure in the knowledge that at the end of the storm, the sea would return to calm. What was needed was intervention in the economy, by government, in order to break the cycle of economic depression, and thereby restore prosperity. Traditionally, in an economic downturn, governments would turn to matters of supply to provide an economic boost, encourage growth, and create employment. For example, if interest rates were reduced, that this should encourage savers to invest their money, providing cash either for existing businesses to expand, or else for entrepreneurs to establish new ventures. However, Keynes now declared there might exist a persistent belief that demand was so low that there was little point in supplying goods. In this case, traditional tools of promoting economic recovery would be useless, and something else would be required. If market mechanisms were unable to stimulate economic recovery, then, Keynes now argued, it was the job of the state to step in to create demand, by running, if necessary, a very large budget deficit in order to create jobs. Practically, this could be done by raising loans and using the money to finance vast public works that could be brought on line relatively quickly. These might include building roads or railways, or else investment in other infrastructure that would not only create work for people, but which would leave a useful legacy for private enterprise. Governments should, for Keynes, act as the primary shopper in the land, creating demand until more widespread sources off-demand can return. Keynes criticized governments for the way they typically respond to downturns. Their immediate (and understandable) impulse is just to rein in spending. After all, this is what a household would do when money is no longer coming in. But what is wise at the level of the household is often catastrophic when applied at the level of the nation. Nations are not households in all kinds of ways, and Keynes needed to persuade his audiences to act contrary to their simpler, more basic instincts. Reining in spending when an economy is in decline always worsens the very problem it's meant to solve. One obvious objection to Keynes' focus on government spending was the question as to who should pay for the loans. By creating the debt, would not the problem be simply postponed to another day, rather than solved? Here, Keynes applied his theory of what became known as the \"Multiplier Effect.\" In the first instance, by creating jobs through public works, governments would save some of the money they would've otherwise spent on unemployment benefits. Secondly, the increase in the number of people in employment would create additional spending power, and therefore boost the economy and tax receipts. There would be an indirect effect on businesses as opportunities to service public works programs became available. The result would be increased tax revenue from businesses, as they began to once again prosper. In turn, these receipts would then pay off the debt created by the initial expenditure. That was the Multiplier Effect. Keynes' ability to conceive of grand macroeconomic architecture put him in a high demand during the Second World War. When he went to the Treasury to work as an advisor, raised the peerage in 1942 as Baron Keynes of Tilton in the County of Sussex, Lord Keynes led the British delegation to the Bretton Woods Conference in the United States, at which the Allied nations hammered out post-war economic policy. Not only did Keynes believe that national governments could successfully manage economies, but Keynes also believed that a global system of economic organization was possible. He argued that, for the purpose of global trade, countries should subscribe to the creation of a new international standardized unit of account: the Bancor. Through a complex system of accounting, the adoption of the pseudo-currency would allow an internationally-recognized organization to impose fines on countries in order to discourage them from running large trade deficits or surpluses. Such a system would help to smooth out peaks and troughs in international trade and, not coincidentally, it would also benefit countries like Britain who had, because of the cost of the War, had low reserves of gold. It was both a brilliant and self-interested idea in equal measure. But, ultimately, the Bancor did not come about. The United States, which was effectively bankrolling global post-war economic reconstruction, ran large trade surpluses and had no intention of accepting limitations on these. But several of Keynes' other proposals, such as the establishment of the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund to oversee and encourage world trade, were accepted, and have dramatically changed the world. Testimony to Keynes' belief that national and super-national economic planning is both necessary and possible. The strain of the Bretton Woods negotiations were immense upon Keynes. In 1946, aged only 62, Keynes died of complications from a series of heart attacks. Yet his legacy lived on. In the thirty years or so after the Second World War, Keynesian policies were adopted across the capitalist world. Economies saw record lows of unemployment, and record high levels of economic growth. Keynes' ideas became the new orthodoxy, and were particularly attractive to the political left. By the 1970s, however, critics of Keynes' ideas, notably, Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman were gaining ground with politicians in countries like the United States and Britain. They argued for small estate, free markets, and a reduction in regulation of capitalist enterprise. At the same time, Britain and the United States began to experience high inflation alongside high unemployment, known as \"stagflation.\" This phenomenon could not be explained by Keynesian economics, and Keynes' ideas came to be discredited, giving way to those of the neoliberals. Nevertheless, the financial crisis of 2008 jolted policymakers into considering alternatives to neoliberal thinking. When the global economy spiralled into decline, rather than wait for the market to correct itself, the G20 nations announced an economic stimulus package of around 2% of gross domestic product to stimulate growth. As one critic of Keynes wryly conceded, \"I guess everyone is a Keynesian in a foxhole.\" To be sure, Keynes' ideas need to be modified to suit the conditions of the contemporary world, but Keynes would approve. His was not a static or dogmatic understanding of economics. After all, when asked why, in the 1930s, he had altered some of the positions on economic policy he had previously held, Keynes famously answered, \"When the facts change, I alter my conclusions. What do you do, sir?\""

    "Title": "How to Narrate Your Life Story",
    "Transcript": "At moments of sorrow and exhaustion, it is only too easy to look back over the years and feel that our lives have, in essence, been meaningless. We take stock of just how much has gone wrong: how many errors there have been; how many unfulfilled plans and frustrated dreams we've had. We may feel like the distraught, damned Macbeth who, on learning of his wife's death, exclaims at a pitch of agony that man is a cursed creature who: …struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more. [Life] is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing. No life can avoid an intermittently high degree of 'sound and fury.' The question is whether it must also, ultimately, signify nothing. As Macbeth's lines hint, this will depend on who is telling it. In the hands of Shakespeare's (bracingly termed) 'idiot', the story of a life may well turn into unintelligible and dispiriting gibberish. But with sufficient compassion and insight, we may equally be able to make something different and a great deal more meaningful and redemptive out of the same material.  The difference between despair and hope is just a different way of telling stories from the same set of facts. Only a small number of us ever self-consciously write our autobiographies. It is a task we associate with celebrities and the very old – but it is, in the background, a universal activity. We may not be publishing our stories, but we are writing them in our minds nevertheless. Every day finds us weaving a story about who we are, where we are going and why events happened as they did. Many of us are strikingly harsh narrators of these life stories. We hint to ourselves that we've been morons from the beginning. We've stuffed up big time. It's been one disaster after another. That's how we go about narrating, especially late at night, when our reserves of optimism run dry and the demons return. Yet there is nothing necessary about our self-flagellating methods of narration. There could always be ways of telling very different, far kinder, and more balanced stories from the very same sets of facts. You could give your life story to Dostoevsky, Proust or Jesus and come out with a rather bearable, moving, tender and noble story. Good – by which is meant fair-minded and judicious – narrators know that lives can be meaningful even when they involve a lot of failure and humiliation. Mistakes do not have to be absurd; they can be signs of how little information we have on which to base the most consequential decisions. Messing up isn't a sign of evil; it's evidence of what we're up against. Not all the disasters were wasted anyway. Maybe we spent a decade not quite knowing what we wanted to do with ourselves professionally. Maybe we went through a succession of failed relationships that left us confused and hurt a lot of people. But these experiences weren't meaningless because they were necessary to later development and maturity. We needed the career crisis to understand our working identities; we had to fail at love to fathom our hearts. No one gets anywhere important in one go. We can forgive ourselves the horrors of our first drafts. The good storyteller recognises – contrary to certain impressions – that the central character of the story isn't always responsible for every calamity or triumph. We are never the sole authors of anything that happens to us. Sometimes, it really will be the economy, our parents, the government, our enemies or simply the tragic dimensions of human existence. Good narrators don't over-personalise. Every day, we are induced to narrate a bit our life story to ourselves: we explain why there was pain, why we forgot to seize a chance and why we're in an unhappy situation. It does not need to be a tale told by an idiot signifying nothing. It can be a tale told by a kind, intelligent soul signifying rather a lot: like almost every life story, it is in truth a tale of a well-intentioned, flawed, partially blind, self-deceived but ultimately dignified and good human struggling against enormous odds and, sometimes, on a good day, succeeding just a little in a few areas. At The School of Life we believe in developing emotional intelligence. To that end we have also created a whole range of products to support that growth.

    "Title": "How To Be A Good Listener",
    "Transcript": "Many of us probably have a nagging feeling that we don't listen enough to other people. Here we're not going to make the guilt worse by telling you that listening is a good thing, worthy but in fact rather dull. We're going to show you that listening to others is first and foremost an interesting thing to do, something that could be as pleasurable for you as it is for your speaking companion. We commonly locate pleasure in conversation as follows: Talking about myself is fun and hearing you, talking about you, is boring. And as a result we try to minimize how much we are listening – and maximise how much we are talking – because that's how it feels like we'll have the most interesting lives. But is this analysis of pleasure really accurate? Of course there is a basic pleasure to be had in, as we put it, 'hearing the sound of our own voice'. But we can also venture that this isn't the real pleasure of talking about ourselves. The real pleasure of talking about ourselves lies in understanding ourselves, becoming clearer about who we are, what we feel, what we want and what we might do next. The pleasure of talking about ourselves lies in self-clarification, not merely in hearing our voices. Generally we tend to believe that Self-Clarification will only be possible if we ourselves actually do the talking. But something far more interesting and redemptive is in truth the case: we can sometimes end up best understanding bits of ourselves by listening to the stories of other people. This might sound like a merely convenient – and sentimental – thing to say. But it is soberly true and the proof lies in an area we know very well: literature. Novels are stories of other people that we don't mind hearing; because they are also, at their best, stories that teach us about ourselves. We're prepared to spend hours hearing other people – like Tolstoy or Proust or Virginia Woolf – talking about their ideas and adventures. And remarkably, we don't mind not getting a single word of our own into the arena because we're actively understanding bits of ourselves by listening to their stories. This is what Marcel Proust had to say on this, he wrote: 'Every reader of a novel is in effect the reader of his own life, whose shape he is better able to appreciate thanks to the spectacles which the novelist has offered him.' We might well reply that this is all very well, but that the average person we have to listen to is a lot less interesting than Marcel Proust. So no wonder we want to listen to the novelist and not the average person. But the people we have around us are a lot more interesting than we think – if only we knew how to listen to them and edit them properly. The reason why so-called great writers are interesting to listen to (even when they talk about themselves) is that they have mastered the trick of teasing out from their experiences what is Universally Relevant from what is Locally Specific. So-called 'great writers' might be telling us a story about their aunt's childhood or a trip to the woods, but in the way they tell us these things, they will be adept at teasing out the Universal Dimension – so that their stories end up being not just local anecdotes with no echoes in the minds of others, but Universal Stories that simultaneously narrate pages in the Universal book of Humankind: they end up being their stories and our own. In truth, we are all living out stories in the Universal Book of Humankind. But we're apt to describe this life so badly, to get so bogged down in local details and unnecessary digressions, that we bore our audiences, giving Listening to someone very negative associations. We haven't got the wrong sort of life; we have the wrong techniques for narrating that life. And by narrating badly, we help to create an enduring suspicion of the act of having to listen to someone else speak. Here is some of what goes wrong when we try to narrate our lives: Firstly we keep latching onto factual details: we go on about times, places, external movements – not realising that things become interesting only when people say what they feel about what happened, not merely what happened. Secondly we often get overwhelmed by an emotion we experienced and insist upon it rather than attempting to explain it. So we say, again and again, 'it was so beautiful' or 'it was the scariest thing in the whole world' but without accurately unpacking the feeling and thereby being able to make it live in someone else's mind. Thirdly just when we promise to get a bit interesting with our narration, we take fright. We get scared of our own emotions, which can threaten to trigger feelings of unbearable sadness, confusion and excitement. We take flight into superficiality. Fourthly, another problem, we don't stick with one story. There is so much in our minds, we keep opening up new subplots.  We're not focusing. When the Good Listener encounters these unfortunate ways of talking, they don't panic; they try to act like good editors. Being a good listener is like being a good editor in a publishing house. Consider the relationship between the American writer Raymond Carver, and his NY editor Gordon Lish. Lish heavily edited Carver – or, as we might put it, listened to him in a hugely creative and transformative way; a way that can teach us about the art of listening in ordinary life as well. – Lish hugely boosted Carver's confidence; he made him feel the world was listening and that it was worth properly unpacking his experiences. He did the editorial equivalent of what in conversation we can call looking closely into someone's eyes with tenderness and sympathy. – He stopped Carver from descending into local tedium. He took Carver's experiences in rural America and gave them a universal dimension, ensuring that Carver is now famous in Korea to Germany as well. – Lastly he stopped Carver digressing; he kept him focused on a central theme in each story he wrote. What we need to do as listeners is a version of what Lish did for Carver. In listening, we can also shape, tease out, cut out, emphasise – in the name of getting the latent really good story to emerge from our companion's mind. So when listening, stop your companion digressing; say things like, 'So a minute ago you were saying that….' Bring them back to the last coherent and emotionally 'alive' part of the story. Draw them away from numb surface details to deeper emotional realities. Ask: 'what did that feel like for you…?' Allow for the unusual and the weird. Use signs that suggest an open mind. Maybe someone is about to say that they felt attracted to their sister or stole money from a company. Don't do anything that might close off a vulnerable confession. 'Say go on…' You're not a judge, you're a friend. The Good Listener knows that one of the best ways to understand an issue in one's own life is to hear it discussed through the life of someone else – and furthermore, they have the editing skills to make sure they can find themselves in the words of others. That way, listening will no longer a chore. It's about the most interesting thing we can ever do with somebody else. We believe in making the world a more emotionally intelligent place. And to that end we have now also published some extraordinary books. As well as other merchandise that re-enforces some of the themes illustrated in our videos.

    "Title": "How Not To Rant",
    "Transcript": "One of the risks of social life is that we will in the course of an evening or in the kitchen at a party end up trapped with a person of excessive conviction or, to put it more colloquially, a bore. Bores can be found harbouring any manner of obsessions: they may be deeply concerned about grammar (and the ever increasing misuse of the subjunctive) or believe that modern architecture has alienated us from ourselves; they may be horrified by the predatory nature of contemporary capitalism or disgusted by the whingeing of the environmental movement; they might hate feminism or see misogyny in every corner of life. Bores aren't necessarily wholly misguided, they may be making some very good points along the way; but our discomfort in their company arises from the intensity and relentlessness of their manner. We long that they might fall silent or, more realistically, allow us to run away. Part of the reason why bores bore is that we sense they are not being entirely honest with us. They are certainly upset, but the real reasons why don't seem on offer. We feel – in the midst of their explanations – that their intensity is drawing heat from a source beyond the argument as they define it. They may well be emphasising a range of studiously impersonal political, economic or social factors, but we intuit that there must be a more personal story from which we, and their conscious selves, have been carefully shielded. It's a general truth, in no way humiliating, that our seemingly-objective adult concerns often have their roots in incidents of personal vulnerability that unfolded long ago and that may be awkward to recover and discuss. Perhaps, when we were young, our father lost his job to a corporation that relocated their offices to south-east Asia: the pay-off was relatively generous but the shame intense for the family. Or perhaps we have been passed over for promotion many times by a young and conspicuously fashionable management team with an interest in contemporary design. Or maybe there was once a woman we liked very much, who was doing a PhD in gender studies on the work of Julia Kristeva and who showed signs of interest but then went off with a rival. It left us quite upset for a while. We may not like to remember these incidents, let alone tell new acquaintances about them at parties. Yet they are still active within us and seek some way, however disguised, of expressing themselves. But all we know consciously is that capitalism is the most abusive and unsustainable economic system ever devised, that modern architecture has shamefully forgotten the nobility of the Classical tradition as embodied by the works of Bramante and Schinkel and that feminists are out to systematically destroy the foundations of male earning power in advanced economies. When we come across such ardent views, it isn't that we want to hear less, it's rather that we would ideally want to hear more – but in another direction, inwards rather than further into socio-cultural and economic abstractions. And we want to do this not from prurience but because social life is guided by a wish to encounter the reality of other people – which is here being arcanely denied. Our boredom is at base an impatient resentment at being held at bay from the genuine traumas of another's life. The bore is never just other people. It is – in given areas – also always us. When we take a psychological audit of our intellectual ideas, we all stand to discover that some of our concerns owe their intensity to personal experiences which are hard to define and frightening to own up to. This alerts us to how we might in the future respond to the speeches of the over-zealous. The task isn't to engage head on with the matter apparently at stake, it's to gently try to shift the conversation away from its official target to its origins; sympathetically asking when the issue first emerged and what more personal associations might surround it. Even if we never get there, the knowledge of the structure of the problem should make us careful not to engage people of excessive conviction in too many prolonged head-to-head arguments. There is no point trying to list why capitalism is not the worst system ever devised, why modern architecture has its high-points and why feminism remains necessary. This would be to believe that the other's rage was a kind of intellectual error that could be magically resolved with the help of one or two deft ideas. The kind conversationalist is more compassionately pessimistic. They accept that the roots of certain of our convictions lie deeply tangled in frightened, anxious parts of the psyche unlikely to be accessible outside psychotherapy. We're so aware that it could sound patronising to treat people as less self-aware than they believe themselves to be, we overlook that it may sometimes also be the height of generosity to keep in mind the complicated role that denied personal wounds play in our ardent convictions. And we should hope that others will repay us the favour the next time we find ourselves delivering long and ever more intense speeches about the decline in handshaking, the colonisation of Ecuador and the corruption of the English language.

    "Title": "How To Argue With Your Partner",
    "Transcript": "Arguments in relationships are typically so regrettable and often so bitter, it's natural to hope we might – with greater maturity – overcome them once and for all. But given what human nature is like, it would be unwise to make this our goal: the hope can't be to eliminate arguments altogether, it should be to try to find our way to a better kind of argument. Arguments tend to start when we are confronted – usually rather suddenly – by what appears to us to be the radical selfishness, intransigence or sheer nastiness of the partner. It is extremely tempting to react with equal force. We aren't, after all, a pushover. We have been hurt and must hurt back. We will make them suffer as they have made us suffer. There may be variations in just how we opt to inflict the suffering. Perhaps we'll do a lot of shouting. Or slam a door. Or maybe we'll eke this one out with a sulk. But the underlying principle is the same: we have been hurt and we have to punish. But at this point, we might ask what we're really seeking. After all, we are not trying to administer abstract justice or punish for the sake of it. This isn't a criminal court or the headmaster's office. What we're truly seeking in a close relationship is something much more touching: we want the other person to love us properly and to be kinder. That's why we're slamming the door, calling them a fuckwit and have been pretending they don't exist since breakfast. Surprisingly, almost the last thing we ever do when we've been very hurt is to say that we've been very hurt. It feels just too humiliating to reveal our wound to the person who inflicted it, to show ourselves as vulnerable in front of the very individual who – it seems – has unbearably abused our vulnerability. This is both hugely understandable and doesn't advance things in the least, because we're not in a relationship to be emotionally safe, we're there to find connection. An act of retribution, while it may give us a momentary impression of impregnability, never increases our chances of obtaining the love and understanding we've formed a couple in order to derive. We might consider a different and slightly paradoxical approach: we might, exactly at the moment when we've been wounded by our partner, instead of hitting back, make what we could term A Dignified Avowal of Hurt and Fear. Rather than get furious, we might attempt to move register and get directly at what is ailing us through a twofold admission. We might say, firstly: I'm so hurt that someone I've put my emotional trust in should say or do that to me. And secondly, (this takes proper courage), we might add: I'm so frightened that I should be emotionally deeply exposed to someone who would appear to hurt me like this. This should give the partner pause for thought. One hasn't insulted them or hurt them back in the usual way – which is what typically blocks their ears and sets off a vicious cycle of attack and counterattack. We are being dignified and honest. We aren't lashing out, but nor are we begging. We are neither being very strong, nor very weak. We are neither punching nor crawling. We are just standing still, admitting our genuine sadness, fear and nakedness in a tone of marked self-possession. Too often, arguments become interminable and, to outsiders, slightly daft because both people refuse to admit that they're sad not mean. It isn't what time to leave for the airport or whose turn it is to do the dishes that's created the argument. It's that both parties are, in different ways, feeling unloved and misunderstood – but are refusing to say this in quite so many words. In a wiser society, we'd study arguments at school for at least four years (they're as complicated as algebra and more important) and we'd all get a lot better at confessing our wounds in a tone of self-possessed dignity. We'd admit with calm that, though we're capable and strong in most areas of our lives, here, right now, in the arena of the relationship, we are hurt and scared – and yet are brave and mature enough, as well committed enough to love, to dare to tell the partner so in the plainest, most undecorated and most heartfelt words. We might save ourselves a lot of time. We believe in making the world a more emotionally intelligent place and to that end we have now also published some extraordinary books.

    "Title": "Why we think so much about our hair",
    "Transcript": "It could seem bizarre quite how long we spend on those strands of stringy keratin that sprout – unreliably – from our scalps. We will, over a lifetime, devote thousands of hours and even more money on hairdressers' careful attempts to coax and sculpt our coiffure into exactly the right colour, shape and dimension. There are days when our entire mood will be supported by a sense that our hair is cooperating and others when our spirits will be just as powerfully ruined by an unfortunate glimpse of our disobedient locks in an elevator mirror. Why does it matter so much? Because – however odd this may sound – we are using our hair to speak. We're trying, through the syntax of coloured protein filaments, to express key aspects about who we are. It is always precarious for us to transmit our identities to those around us. We rely on other, accompanying details: our shoes, our jewellery, our clothes – and of course, most centrally, those strands of hair. Everyone's hair speaks in a slightly specific dialect, but we can with relative ease define some of the main entries in humanity's vast and nuanced Dictionary of Hair: Tightly pulled back: We're letting the world know that we are busy, organised and not to be interrupted lightly. Long, flowing and tangled: We are reminding society of our opposition to some of the demands of modern capitalism. We're spiritual beings, our hair is saying, we have a heart and make the time to notice what really counts. Emphatic side-parting: We're using hair to tell others that we're careful, modest, patient, sensible and very willing to be realistic. We can be relied upon. Brushed forward, closely cropped, in the manner of a Roman General: We're too immersed, our hair informs society, in the real battles of life to care about trivia; we make our hair obey. We have grown indifferent to criticism and – in a good way – hard to impress. Hair truly is a subtle and intricate language. The problem – or even the tragedy – is that other people aren't necessarily paying very much attention to what it is saying. We encounter this awkward reality in the difficult moments after our return from an expensive and slow-moving hairdresser. We rejoin our friends or lovers with an expectant 'what do you think?' only to receive mildly confused responses: 'those trousers suit you' or 'have you lost weight?' We felt that it mattered so ardently that the locks are now combed just a little more to the left and are one shade closer to blonde: others don't give a damn, though in the privacy of their own bathrooms, they too will take immense care about what their hair is saying. The conversation we have with hair appears close to an immensely expensive, laborious, self-conscious dialogue of the deaf. And yet what we're encountering, in the limited context of hair, is simply a problem that haunts us throughout our lives: the essential loneliness of the human animal. We have an extraordinarily limited power to get others to care about and understand us the way we so crave to be grasped. And vice versa. We should not mock others for caring so much about their hair – or berate ourselves for doing the same. We're just engaged in the poignant business of attempting to communicate who we are. With all those dyes, curlers, tongs and scissors, we're just trying to make ourselves a little more clearly understood in a world with painfully little inclination to care. .

    "Title": "How to Have a Good Conversation",
    "Transcript": "\"Old Boy... is it a guy trapped in a room?\" \"Yeah, yeah, yeah... basically. It has a twist-- just wait for the end of it.\" It can be painfully rare to end up in a satisfying conversation. A lot of the time, we talk and we listen, but sincere, deep connection eludes us. \"Oil, the yeast and pan... it reacts differently and some more healthy or less. I-- like, grapeseed oil is actually really... I like that. I mean it's very...\" We shouldn't blame ourselves for the difficulties we face in conversations. After all, no one ever particularly taught us how to have a conversation, though it might have have helped. \"This is the, um, well it's not the orbital, is it? It's the other one. [incoherent] Well, there's people trying to get to work, people trying to get to school, I mean, so-- it's just so stupid.\" Too often, when we meet and talk, we stay on the surface of events. We say what happened, where we went, who we saw; not how we felt, or what it meant to us. We talk about facts, not feelings, which are the only conduits to real connection. \"... thing-- that's the issue. It's like when you're on that platform you see there's Royston, Natural Garden City, and Welling Garden City. And that's the thing-- a lot of people are there on that platform and they don't know that they could change your Alexandra Palace...\" Or else, we insist rather than explain feelings, thereby failing to get them into other people's minds. \"... like so amazing. I still got like-- even thinking of it now, it's just like... UHHH! Uh... you know the... yeah, you know when you're kind of... oh, God it was great. Oh, so good.\" Typically, we skirt the raw and intense emotions and  head for safe, but bland, adminstrative chat. \"I used to eat meat... and then, obviously when me and James broke up and I became vegetarian. I've found... just absolutely the most amazing recipe book. It's literally-- I don't know if you've seen it and it's got like-- you can replace... sort of the dish that you would have with meat in it...\" Or else, we simply can't keep a conversation on track. We repeatedly, as it were, open new windows, digressing until the thread is lost. \"So I was thinking-- I was actually thinking of playing poker this weekend with uh... you know, my mates, but I don't play anymore because I lost a bit of money last year, and I know. There's just so much to read now... you know what I mean? I'm more interested in reading, if anything... I am going skiing next week, so... I don't know, it's not the kind of place you might read but...\" The good news is that we can learn to shape others' conversations rather than just receive them passively. In a dialogue, there are always what one might term, \"conversational crossroads,\" with paths that lead either to greater intimacy, or else towards ongoing superficiality. Here is one conversational crossroads: \"I'm inviting some friends over next week who I haven't seen since uni.\" At this point, you could go in one of two ways. A surface way: \"Oh cool, what university did you go to?\" \"Manchester.\" \"Oh, yeah, it's really fun. Manchester, yeah. My sister went there. What did you study?\" \"Business.\" \"What-- what did you do in the second half for?\" \"Well, I ended up in Events Management, but yeah.\" \"I did French.\" Or, you could steer things down a more emotional path: \"I'm inviting some friends over next week who I haven't seen since uni.\" \"Oh my God, it's like what? 10, 12 years?\" \"Yeah, that's when I fini-- got my degree, yeah. \"So, I mean, you've all completely changed... I mean, you've changed.\" \"Yeah, I guess I have, yeah. I suppose so. Haven't really thought about it that much.\" \"What would you think or say-- I mean, if you could see you then now?\" Good listeners are like good editors: trimming away what's superfluous, trying gently to get the speaker to focus on what's really at stake. \"And after my mum died, as you can probably guess, there was quite a bit of stress... um. Well uh, not helped by the fact that my favorite football team at the time,  Manchester United, was going through a losing streak--\" \"So, but you were saying that, um, that your parents got divorced and then literally three months later your mum passed away?\" \"Yes. It was all quick... quick quick.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Um, but yeah. I've got a friend-- uh, Dave, um, or David, as he's called at work, because obviously that's a bit informal--\" \"Sorry, but you were saying like it just-- like it all happened really quickly and like when your mum went to the hospital you didn't actually know she was ill before...\" The other great surprise about conversations is how much we like it when people show vulnerability. We always think that what we need to do to get other people to like us is to show how well things are going for us. Surprisingly, that's actually not very appealing. \"It's so well paid, um... and which is great in terms of, you know, now I can afford, you know, to live in Canterbury which is gorgeous and I love my flat, um... so yeah, it's been really, really positive, actually.\" It's not that we want others to fail; we just need to know that our own sorrows have echoes in the lives of others. That's what connects us; strength may be impressive, but it's vulnerability that builds friendships. \"Yes, I guess I've... missed her every day since then... which is mad because, you know, I'm a grown man now... got a responsible job, got a family, got my own home, but when it comes down to it... I just miss my mum.\" It's so poignant that we make so much effort to come together, but often don't manage to connect. The good news is, we can learn how to. The connections we long for are just waiting for us to make the right moves, to secure them. We believe in making the world a more emotionally intelligent place, and to that end, we've now also published some extraordinary books, as well as other merchandise that reinforces some of the themes illustrated in our videos.

    "Title": "What Is Narcissism?",
    "Transcript": "Accusing someone of narcissism has become one of the great and tempting insults of our age. It is what we are inclined to label anyone who appears overweening, boastful, entitled or excessively pleased with their own existence. But it's possible to wonder whether the word really fits the conceited and bombastic types we've grown used to applying it to – and, a larger point, whether we're really understanding, and therefore correctly addressing, the origins of the regrettable behaviour to which it refers. Behind our enthusiastic use of the term lies an implicit theory of human nature: that people seek undue attention for themselves, grow pretentious and inclined to bombast when – at heart – they feel an extraordinary love for who they are. It is their hugely high estimation of themselves, combined with their robust pride in everything they are and do, that is at the root of their tendencies to talk up their own achievements and to try to secure the admiration of strangers. But, on closer examination, it seems that the agitation and peacock displays cannot really stem from a feeling of being perfectly and requitedly enamoured of oneself. Those whom we loosely call narcissists can't actually think so well of themselves; they boast and show off because they can't find a way of being sufficiently content with who they really are – and are driven on by a manic, haunting terror of their own invisibility and mediocrity. The behaviours we associate with narcissism – the vanity, the greed, the lies – aren't symptoms of self-love, they are proof of its dangerous, tragic absence. Let's recall the original Greek myth from where the word descends. Narcissus was a hunter from central Greece, the son of the river god Cephissus and the nymph Liriope. He had long flowing locks, deep blue eyes, unblemished skin and full enchanting lips. One day, as he walked past a quiet pool of water, he caught sight of his own reflection, failed to recognise himself and was entranced with the image. He had never seen anyone quite so enchanting – and could not stop falling profoundly in love with himself, the most admirable and bewitching being he had ever spotted. Framed like this, narcissism sounds laughable and absurd. But derogatory remarks make us lose sight of the genuine benefits of having been able, when young, under the tutelage of kindly caregivers, properly to admire oneself without reserve, to have been allowed to strut and sing and feel utterly home in one's own skin and, for a time, delight amply in the sheer wondrousness of one's existence. There might be such a thing as good narcissism: a phase of coming to love oneself that is the precondition for knowing how to love anyone else. Most of the problems of the world are created by people who do not love themselves.  Who cannot inwardly believe in their own worth; those who grew up with a searing hatred and shame about who they were – and who now cannot stop insistently claiming an attention of which they were once deprived. One has to despise oneself really rather a lot before it ever seems like a good idea to devote one's life to trying to prove valuable in the eyes of complete strangers. By contrast, the really self-contented ones among us are those who have no burning need for adulation and know how to draw quiet satisfaction from nothing more than their own unadorned, ordinary being. We should want to build a world not where there are fewer people who have loved themselves but where there are many more, a world richer in what we can term healthy narcissism. We will be modest and self-effacing, ready to be quietly interested in and attentive to others, happy to forego baubles and manic acclaim, when we've had a chance to gaze at our reflection awhile and think it really pretty nice – nice enough for us to go out and start generously to spread kindness and selflessness to those around us.

    "Title": "Good Enough Is Good Enough",
    "Transcript": "High ambitions are noble and important, but there can also come a point when they become the sources of terrible trouble and unnecessary panic. One way of undercutting our perfectionist impulses was pioneered by a British psychoanalyst called Donald Winnicott in the 1950s. Winnicott specialised in relationships between parents and children. In his clinical practice, he often met with parents who felt like failures: perhaps because their children hadn't got into the best schools, or because there were sometimes arguments around the dinner table or the house wasn't always completely tidy. Winnicott's crucial insight was that the parents' agony was coming from a particular place: excessive hope. Their despair was a consequences of a cruel and counterproductive perfectionism. So as to help them reduce this, Winnicott developed a charming phrase: his parents needed to feel that they were \"good enough parents\", No child, he insisted, needs an ideal parent. They just need an OK, pretty decent, usually well intentioned, sometimes grumpy but basically reasonable father or mother. Winnicott wasn't saying this because he liked to settle for second-best, but because he knew, from first hand, the toll exacted by perfectionism – and realised than in order to remain more or less sane (which is a pretty big ambition already) we have to learn not to hate ourselves for failing to be what no ordinary human being ever really is anyway. The concept of 'good enough' was invented as an escape from dangerous ideals. It began in relation to parenthood, but it can actually be applied across life more generally, especially around work and love. A relationship may be 'good enough' even while it has many dark moments. Perhaps at times there's little sex and a lot of heavy arguments. Maybe there are big areas of loneliness and non-communication. Yet none of this should lead us to feel freakish or unnaturally unlucky. It can be good enough. Similarly, a 'good enough' job will be very boring at points, it won't perfectly utilise all our merits; we won't earn a fortune. But we may make some real friends, have times of genuine excitement and finish many days tired but with a sense of true accomplishment. It takes a good deal of bravery and skill to keep even a very ordinary life going. To persevere through the challenges of love, work and children is quietly heroic. We should perhaps more often sometimes step back in order to acknowledge in a non-starry-eyed but very real way that our lives are good enough – and that this is, in itself, already a very grand achievement.

    "Title": "How To Keep Growing Up",
    "Transcript": "The business of growing up is something we normally think comes to a close when we get to 16 or so – and finally turn into those fully finished products: adults. Up until then, our growth is the subject of quite a lot of collective fascination. Twentieth-century psychology, beginning with the work of the Swiss clinician Jean Piaget, pioneered an approach to child development that meticulously identified and labelled every principal stage an average infant might go through on the developmental journey of its earliest years. Thanks to this work, we now know that at six months, a child will be able to sit up on its own, pick up a small object (such as a raisin) using a thumb and forefinger and recognise its own image in a mirror, though it will most likely take another three months before it can drink from a cup on its own and understand simple requests. By two, it will start to say 'I' and 'you' and it will probably be able to put on a hat by itself. Around four, one can expect it to use sentences several words long and quite possibly invent an imaginary friend (an achievement that belongs to what Piaget called the Symbolic Function Substage). Between the ages of four and seven, children begin to grasp abstract concepts like 'time' and 'a country' but typically make mistakes around the use of 'less than' and 'more than'. Parents, uncles, aunts and grand-parents tend to be deeply interested in these developmental milestones – which become the stuff of family legend. However, after about 16, the attention society pays to the maturation of an individual becomes ever more coarsely grained. The focus shifts to external, material matters: we track what someone gets in their university degree, what job they secure and how they progress up the corporate hierarchy. Growing up becomes synonymous with getting ahead. Yet, in truth, we never stop having opportunities to grow in an emotional – rather than material or physical way. Perhaps between the ages of 19 and 21, without anyone really focusing on this happening, we may radically rethink our view of how to handle our parents' shortcomings. Or our view of envy takes a leap forward in the middle of our 23rd year. Or, as we approach 33, lying in bed early one morning in a hotel, we amend our sense of who is to blame in certain relationship difficulties. We may look more or less the same, but inside, slow, unheralded moments of emotional growth can be going on. Unfortunately, we have nothing like the clear, detailed stages to measure ourselves against that babies and young children enjoy – and that might give us the encouragement we would need to note and foster stages of growth. Yet, every adult life contains the potential to acquire new emotional skills, each in its own way as significant as a child mastering a quirk of language (in English, for instance, saying 'I thought rather than I thinked') or learning to ride a bicycle. To develop emotionally involves a range of steps: learning to understand and sympathise with oneself; to take proper stock of one's childhood influences; to communicate flaws and eccentricities to others in good time, to interpret others beyond what they have directly said to us, to recognise the hard edges of reality without being destroyed by them, to accept one's needs for consolation and assistance, to achieve a necessary degree of confidence, to know how to despair without wholly giving up on existence… We can imagine plotting the inner journey like islands, each one of them marked by settlements, which we should take the trouble systematically to work our way around, as we might the cities of Renaissance Italy, or the beauty spots on the Pacific Highway. We'd tell our friends excitedly that we'd learnt about Emotional Translation or had achieved excellent grades in Communication. We might throw a party when we'd learnt how to do Cheerful Despair. Despite misleading external signs, we aren't, in fact, ever done with the tricky business of becoming that hugely important thing: an emotionally mature person or, to put it another, simpler way, a real grown-up.

    "Title": "How To Be Selfish",
    "Transcript": "We're always hearing that being selfish is one of the worst character traits that anyone could possess. It's smacks of greed, entitlement, and cruelty. And yet, some of the reason we fail to have the lives we should, and thereby end up mean, bitter, and irritable, is because we're suffering from an opposite problem: an excessive selflessness-- an exaggerated modesty, an over-hasty deference to the wishes of everyone but ourselves. Our problem is that we're not selfish enough. We collectively get muddled because we fail to distinguish between good and bad versions of selfishness. The good, desirable kind of selfishness involves having the courage and self-awareness to give priority to ourselves at particular points, the confidence to be forthright about our needs-- not in order to harm or reject other people, but in order to serve them in a deeper, more sustained and committed way over the long term. Bad selfishness, on the other hand, operates with no greater end in view, and no higher motive in mind. We're not declining to help so as to marshal our resources, to offer others a greater gift down the line, we just can't be bothered. Unfortunately, afflicted by confusion about this distinction, we frequently fail to be brave enough about stating our needs as clearly as we should, with disastrous results precisely for those we're meant to serve. For example, in order to be a good parent, we may need to have an hour to ourselves every day. We may need to take a long time in a hot shower to mull over events. We may need to do something that seems a bit indulgent, like a life drawing or clarinet lesson. But because we may sense how contrary to expectations these desires can seem, we might opt to stay quiet about our requirements and just get on with the job. And so, we grow increasingly ragged, angry, and bitter with those who rely on us. A lack of selfishness can turn us-- slowly-- into highly disagreeable, as well as ineffective, people. Good selfishness grows out of an unembarrassed understanding of what we need in order to maximize our utility for others. As good selfish people, we accept what we require to develop our abilities, get our minds into the right frame, summon our most useful powers, and organize our thoughts and feelings so that they can, eventually, be helpful to the world. We recognize that we will, at select moments, have to back out of doing things that people would very much like us to do. But we have no compunction about politely explaining that we just can't be there for them... unlike the selfless, who will dutifully smile and help out and then one day explode in vindictive, exhausted rage. We know, as kind egoists, that we may be confused with the mean-spirited, but our innate conviction of our sincerity lends us the calm to pursuit our aims politely in our own way. So as not to be accused of the wrong sort of selfishness, the trick is to become a better ambassador of your intentions. We have to persuasively and kindly convey to those around us that we're not lazy or callous (and indeed we're not), but we have to show them that we will simply better serve their needs by not doing the expected things for a while. Sweet people run the strange but highly important risk of becoming an nuisance to other people by what sounds like, but really isn't, a good idea: always putting others first. As good, selfish people know, sometimes, putting oneself first may actually be the best way to serve others properly in the long run."

    "Transcript": "There are many things, we want to ask of other people we want to ask for a job for money, a chance to collaborate, a kiss but, generally we don't ask because of a terror of a no why should a no, such a small and innocuous word prove quite so painful, so hard to hear so much something we need to avoid that we'd rather die in penury ignored, and unfulfilled than ever heared it's because it's not a case of trying not to hear a no what we are trying to do, is avoid hearing something quite different that we are disgusting all of us have access to a disgusting self-image a repertoire of all the most broken floored embarassing and weak sides of who we are and it's precisely this self-image that is awoken and engaged whenever people say no to us we are not heaing no we'd be fine if we were we're hearing: you are an arrogant laughable jumped up illusional clumsy repulsive pond-life now wonder, we got reluctant to ask but in truth of course, others are not remotely saying this to us they can't guess how we are feeling inside it's not written on our forehead, and most importantly it's not even true we've got some tricky sides of course, but so does everyone else we are a mixture of good and bad like everyone else we are okay, we deserve to exist when people say no, they are not thinking about us here is the only reason why people ever say no and we need this emblazened on billboards so we don't forget it but real reason people say no,  is that it doesn't fit in with their plans they are not thinking about your stupidest deeds, the nicknames people called you at school or what you get up to late at night that's in your head, not theirs they are just worried about their plans we are losing out on some consoling insights because we are failing to bring our own experience of what we felt when we said no to people we said no not because we hated them we did it for an obvious now repeated reason it didn't fit in with our plans but here is the key reason to try asking we just don't know where people are with their plans and we can be sure of this by looking at our own experience when we think about it, there are actually a suprising number of things that we would theoretically give other people if only they asked we would say yes at many perhaps suprising points we would ready to give certain people money, time, kisses if they asked but usually people don't ask because they don't know where we are with our lives all of us are fundamentally ignorant of other people's plans we just can't really tell what others might say yes or no because we don't have access to their projects and visions we are attempting to overcome our the lack of data by foreclosing in a pessimistic direction but we should instead simply try to get more data by asking we should respond to ignorants with curiosity, not to spare we should remember to that we can survive a no from a distance we feel it would be a catastrophy if it were a no from close-up, we can be sure we'd shrug it off in 3 hours we're big people now of course as small children we were very vulnerable and perhaps adults said no to us at key moments, and it hurt and now, we are trying not to get hurt again but the mind is slow to realise the time we've grown, we perhaps 6 feet tall now we have a bank account, perhaps a car, maybe children of our own we can survive a no and in any case, not asking is not cost-free we are avoiding the pain of rejection but we are settling for something that is more insidious and just as troubling a lack of opportunity not asking life for something means implicitly asking it for something else failure from the outset and this is especially sad because life is so very short what we should really be scared of is not a no but reaching on deathbeds unfulfilled we should ask"

    "Title": "How To Choose A Partner Wisely",
    "Transcript": "How do we choose the people we fall in love with? In the modern world, under the ideology of 'Romanticism' you're meant above all, to Trust Your Feelings! Love is a mutual ecstasy at finding a beautiful person, inside and out, with the rare capacity, to make us happy. The romantic attitude sounds warm and kind. It's originators certainly imagined that it would bring to an end the sort of unhappy relationships that resulted from the old ways of finding a partner; the arranged marriage! The only problem is that this call for us to trust our instincts has very often proved to be a disaster of its own. Respecting the special feelings we get around certain people in night-clubs, or train stations; at parties or on websites and that romanticism so ably celebrated an art appears not to have led us to be any happier in our unions The Medieval couple shackled into marriage by two royal courts keen to preserve the sovereignty of a slice of ancestral land. Instinct has been little better than calculation in underwriting the quality of our love stories. There's another school of thought: this one influenced by psychotherapy which challenges the notion that trusting instinct invariably draws us to those who will make us happy. That's because the theory points out that we don't fail in love first and foremost with those who care for us in ideal ways We fall in love with those who care for us in familiar ways. And there might be, a big difference. Adult love is modeled on a template of love created in childhood. And is likely to be entwined with a range of problematic attractions that militate in key ways against our chances of growth and happiness, as adults. We may believe we are seeking happiness in love but what we are really after is familiarity We're looking to recreate within our adult relationships the very feelings we knew so well in childhood And which were rarely limited to just tenderness and care. The love many of us would've tasted early on was confused with other perhaps more destructive dynamics Feelings of wanting to help an adult who is out of control or of being deprived of a parent's warmth. Or scared of his/her anger or of not feeling secure enough to communicate our trickier wishes How logical then, that we should as adults find ourselves rejecting certain candidates not because they're wrong for us but because they're a little too right In a sense of seeming somehow excessively balanced, mature, understanding and reliable given that in our hearts such rightness feels foreign and unearned To choose our partners wisely, we need to tease out how certain compulsions to suffering may be playing themselves out in our feelings of attraction. A useful starting place is to ask ourselves perhaps in the company of a large sheet of paper, a pen and a free afternoon what sort of people in the abstract put us off and what kinds excite us. To try to trace back qualities to the people who first loves us in childhood and to ask ourselves how much our impulses really are aligned with things that might make us happy We could stand to discover for example that slightly distant and sadistic people do always more interesting to us than the so-called 'nice' ones. That should make us stop and think. Our honestly described reactions are legacies They are revealing underlying assumptions we've acquired that what love for us can feel like. We may start to get a clearer picture that our vision of what we're looking for in another person might not be in a specially good guide to our personal happiness. Examining our emotional histories we learn that we can't just be attracted to anyone we're limited in the types we have because of certain things that happened to us in our past. Even if we can't always radically shift these pattern it's useful to know that we're carrying a ball and chain It can make us more careful of ourselves when we feel overwhelmed by a certainty that we've met the one after just a few minutes chatting at the bar. Or when we're certain someone is just brawn or boring even though objectively, they do have a lot going for them. Ultimately, we stand to be liberated to love different people to our initial types, when we find that the qualities we like and the ones we very much fear can be found in different constellations from those we encountered in the people who first thought us about affection long ago, in a childhood we should strive to understand and in many ways, free ourselves from."

    "Title": "The Nightmare of Colleagues",
    "Transcript": "One of the most frightening aspects of working life is that we will, unless we are the beneficiaries of extreme good fortune, be required to have colleagues. The colleague is a creature who, endured over any length of time, in situations of high stress and procedural complexity, presents one of the greatest threats to calm, composure and soundness of mind. It was so much easier when we were kids. We could lie on the bedroom floor and, in a few minutes of play, build a plane, run a restaurant, or invade a country on our own. The problem with colleagues starts with the facts that they can't guess what we want. Everything needs to be explained to them, often very slowly and repeatedly. If this were not bad enough, many colleague are at risk of disagreeing with us about many things. They turn out to have a host of contrary opinions, their own quirks, pet peeves and obsessive interests and, yet worse, they are very sensitive. If lone behold we have to manage with them, unless we speak them in the right way, they'll become offended, develop grudges, start to cry, or report one to a superior. In the good old days, you could just shout. When most work was physical, management could be abrupt, emotional distress didn't hold things up. One could still operate the brick making machine at maximum speed, even if one hated the manager, or clean out the stables thoroughly even if one felt the foreman hadn't enquired deeply enough into the nature of one's weekend. But nowadays, most jobs require a high degree of psychological well-being in order to be performed adequately. A wounding comment can destroy a person's productivity for a whole day. Without ample respect, recognition and encouragement, huge sums of money will get wasted in silently resentful moods. If one has any concern for the bottom line, it seems one has little alternative but to try to be a bit nice. Work relationships are no less tricky than romantic ones, but at least in the latter, we have a basic sense of security that enables one to speak one's mind and make the necessary cathartic moves, to call them fuckwits and compress a range of ideas in the occasional expletive loaded outburst. The office environment misses out on the cleansing frankness seemingly possible only when two people know they will have the option of having sex together after the bust-up. At the heart of our office agonies is the complaint that we seldom like our colleagues as people. In a better world, we would be unlikely ever to want to spend any time at all with such disturbing, and often unlikely, figures. We shouldn't be surprised by our daily discomfort, given that these people were never picked out on the basis of psychological compatibility. We were formed into a unit because they had a range of technical and commercial competences necessary for a task, not because they were fun lunch companions or were graced with a pleasing manner. We are like the unfortunate bride in a power-marriage in the middle ages. A princess would be obliged to marry a certain prince because he owned an important led mine or the archers in his country were especially proficient. It would have been nice if the two liked each other a bit as well, but the stakes were generally far too high for this to be a relevant factor. The success of the realm depended on such matters as access to raw materials and military strength, not on whether the partner had a maddening giggle or a daunting overbite. To work well around colleagues requires not talent per se, but success at a range of dark psychological arts best summoned up by the word 'politics'. But political skill has woefully little in common with the reasons we were trained and hired to do our jobs in the first place. We may, as part of a good business education, have spent years studying the way to navigate a balance sheet, analyse competitors, negotiate contracts, and administer a logistics chain. But life at work requires quite different skills: the capacity to quietly accept glory for things that were not truly our doing; to distance ourselves from errors in which we were heavily  implicated; to subtly foreground the failings of otherwise quite able colleagues; to turn cold at key moments towards emotionally vulnerable superiors; to flatter while not appearing to do so; to mould our views to suit the currently ascendant attitudes. Our inevitable difficulties are aggravated by notions that offices are at heart really giant families, that colleagues can be friends, that honesty is rewarded and that talent will win out. Kindly sentimentality is in the end, just a disguised version of cruelty. It might be a lot simpler if, in dark moments, we could simply admit to what we know in our hearts: that it would obviously be a great deal better if we could be shot of the whole business of colleagues and could instead spend our days, as we used to do so well, on our own."

    "Title": "What It's Like Inside Our Minds",
    "Transcript": "From the outside, people's minds seem like pretty  straightforward places. What we hear people saying suggests a certain logic, order and coherence. But inside the mind, it's a VERY different matter. Here, things are infinitely more complex, fractured, multilayered, and confusing Amidst the shadowy tangled darkness, one could imagine a single brightly lit zone like a spotlight in a cave. The area that normally goes by the term \"consciousness\". This is where we do our rational thinking. Where ideas are clarified, where plans are put on a systematic footing, where we order and clean up our thoughts but the key thing about the way we work is that unless we take very special measures, most of what is inside the mind will remain far outside the spotlight of consciousness in what we can call the \"unconscious zones\". These unconscious zones contain recesses and grottos filled with unknown disavowed thoughts and feelings feelings you HAD, without properly experiencing emotions we FELT without properly registering Here, we find our record of pretty much everything we've ever seen Where we been to, who we've met, and how we felt. Most of the time, the images are dormant and submerged, then occasionally, at what can feel like random points, an image will suddenly come back to us as clear as day suddenly, we'll see Uncle Ernie or the pier in Britain or the train taking us up the Matterhorn When we were nine A lot of what lies in the unconscious are worries, things were frightened might happen at which we push out of consciousness We keep them at bay but the effort creates a hum and static of background anxiety In the unconscious, the (there are) desires that can't find a place in our more ordered, sensible, day-to-day lives there are ideas we haven't had time to sort out and angry, hurt feelings we haven't digested a sadness we haven't dared to feel When we speak of getting to know ourselves, of increasing self-knowledge, really what we mean is the task of getting more active with the spotlight of consciousness moving it around more regularly in our minds more systematically shining its beams into unfamiliar corners so that we're less surprised and frightened by some of what we have in our minds our founding belief is that the more of the mind we can light up with consciousness, the more peaceful, coherent and focused we can be. this is what it means to lead an examined life to try to become less of a stranger to oneself by illuminating our minds with a spotlight of consciousness."

    "Title": "Be the Change You Want to See",
    "Transcript": "We spend a lot of time trying to change other people. There is, after all, so much wrong with them: they're selfish, arrogant, bullying, weak, cold, needy and so on. So we try to point some of this stuff out and often meet with resistance, denial or sheer indifference. This can be very agitating and hence renders us cross and severe. Why won't people take our lessons on board? In our behaviour, we tend to be making an implicit distinction between two projects: getting other people to change – and changing ourselves. We know we may have to develop in certain ways, but for now, our focus is on altering others. We make an evolution in our own behaviour conditional on evolutions in other people's. We vow that we'll be nicer if they're nicer, that we'll be less strident if they give up shouting. However, we're prone to miss an important insight: changing how you behave to others can be the fastest way to alter how others behave towards you. People tend – to a remarkable extent – to mirror behaviour. If someone is aggressive around them, they become aggressive back. If someone is gentle, they become soft in return. If someone acts wisely, it'll draw any latent reserves of wisdom out of the audience. We're often in the paradoxical position of advocating one kind of behaviour while making use of quite another. We might quite angrily suggest that someone else calm down. Or we may bullyingly insist to a person that they try to be more empathetic. We deserve sympathy. It's the agitation and anxiety of trying to teach that can easily take us far from the behaviour we're advocating. Here it bears to remember a saying often falsely attributed to Mahatma Gandhi though eminently useful nevertheless: \"Be the change you want to see.\" It captures something key: how sensible it may often be to give up on teaching directly in order to try teach by example. This has one great advantage: we can control ourselves while it's remarkably hard to exert any sort of direct control over anyone else. Our disappointment with other people should be redirected towards exerting control over the one thing we can reliably command: ourselves. Seeing us exhibiting certain virtues has a remarkable ability to inspire others into imitating us. And even if change is not immediate, we can at least take pride in the integrity of our position, knowing that we've had the strength and dignity already to started to become the change we want to see."

    "Title": "In Defence Of 'Needy' People",
    "Transcript": "The 'needy' person is a stock figure of caricature: they call too much, they cry when you leave to get a glass of water, they feel put out when you check your phone, they were upset when you watched a film without them. We hate needy people a lot. But let's look at this another way. There are, of course, a few pathologically dependent people at large, but a lot of the time, far more than is generally accepted, the person who has the problem isn't the 'needy' person at all, it is us; the ones who are doing the accusing. We will feel someone is sickeningly 'needy' when we don't see ourselves as appropriate targets of someone else's need. Somewhere inside, we don't trust that we are reliable, strong, dependable, admirable or decent; we aren't quite grown-up, and those who need something from us therefore come across as deranged and fitting targets for mockery. At the first sign that someone is becoming reliant on us, we flinch. We suspect that someone who needs us enough to depend on us for a pleasant weekend or evening must be diseased. At the root of our hatred of so-called needy people is self-hatred. Ostensibly, we all want love, but when love actually starts to be reciprocated, it may prove intensely alarming if we are not convinced of our own lovability. We can start to think very badly of the person we liked only a little time before. We feel they are naive in finding us wonderful, a great deal more wonderful than we feel we are. We think them gullible, and too easily taken in by a character we ourselves don't believe in. The solution isn't necessarily to try to change a lover, by telling them to stop asking so much. They most probably aren't asking too much at all. They just aren't afflicted with a sense that it is peculiar to be loved or to love. Put another way, they're just strong enough to reveal that they aren't invulnerable and judicious enough to like the look of us. They rightly presume showing need is a precondition of strength rather than weakness. The solution is to revise our view of ourselves; to see ourselves as more or less plausible people for someone else to stand in need of. The fear of 'needy' people is only a species of self-hatred rippling outwards to tar our lover. A reduction of self-hatred doesn't depend on self-boosterism (telling ourselves how great we are). We should learn to tolerate ourselves not by believing that we are wonderful, but via a secure realisation that everyone is both OK and sometimes a bit awful: that is enough to deserve love. We can be cured of our uncommonly vicious self-suspicion by a more accurate vision of what constitutes normality. Of course we are a bit a weak, a bit sly and a bit foolish, to put it gently. But so is everyone. We're no more idiotic or wayward than the next person. We can embrace a person's hopes for a close and deep relationship with us simply on the basis that we are, in fact, all a bit odd and broken. The need that the lover has of us isn't delusional, it's an accurate request that any flawed human might make of another comparably damaged example. We'll start to find other people a lot less needy, that is, a lot less alarming when they need us, when we can accept with good grace that there is nothing unusually strange or abhorrent about someone deciding they like us."

    "Title": "Machiavelli's Advice For Nice Guys",
    "Transcript": "POLITICAL THEORY MACHIAVELLI'S ADVICE FOR NICE GUYS Machiavelli is a 16th century Florentine political thinker, with powerful advice for nice people who don't get very far. His thought pivots around a central, uncomfortable observation: that the wicked tend to win. And they do so because they have a huge advantage over the good: they are willing to act with the darkest ingenuity and cunning to further their cause. They are not held back by those rigid opponents of change: principles. They will be prepared to outright lie, twist facts, threaten or get violent. They will also, when the situation demands it, know how to seductively deceive, use charm and honeyed words, bedazzle and distract. And in this way, they conquer the world. It's routinely assumed that a large part of what it means to be a good person is that one acts well. One doesn't only have good ends, one is committed to good means. So if one wants a more serious world, one needs to win people over through serious argument, not clickbait. If one wants a fairer world, one has to judiciously and gently try to persuade the agents of injustice to surrender willingly, not through intimidation. And if one wants people to be kind, one must show kindness to one's enemies, not ruthlessness. It sounds splendid but Machiavelli couldn't overlook an incontrovertible problem. It doesn't work. As he looked back over the history of Florence and the Italian states more generally, he observed that nice princes, statesmen and merchants always come unstuck. This was why he wrote the book for which we know him today, The Prince, a short dazzling manual of advice for well-disposed princes on how not to finish last. And the answer, in short, was to be as nice as one wished, but never to be overly devoted to acting nicely: and indeed to know how to borrow, when need be, every single trick employed by the most cynical, dastardly, unscrupulous and nastiest people who have ever lived. Machiavelli knew where our counter-productive obsession with acting nicely originated from: the West was brought up on the Christian story of Jesus of Nazareth, the very nice man from Galilee who always treated people well and wound up as the king of kings and the ruler of eternity. But Machiavelli pointed out one inconvenient detail to this sentimental tale of the triumph of goodness through meekness. From a practical perspective, Jesus's life was an outright disaster. This gentle soul was trampled upon and humiliated, disregarded and mocked. Judged in his lifetime and outside of any divine assistance, he was one of history's greatest losers. The clue to being effective lies in overcoming all vestiges of this story. The Prince was not, as is often thought, a guide to being a tyrant; it's a guide about what nice people should learn from tyrants. It's a book about how to be effective, not just good. It's a book haunted by examples of the impotence of the pure. The admirable prince, and today we might add, the CEO, political activist or thinker should learn every lesson from the slickest, most devious operators around. They should know how to scare and intimidate, cajole and bully, entrap and beguile. The good politician needs to learn from the bad one; the earnest entrepreneur from the slick one. We are all ultimately the sum of what we achieve, not what we intend. If we care about wisdom, kindness, seriousness and virtue, but only ever act wisely, kindly, seriously and virtuously, we will, Machiavelli warned us, get nowhere. We need to learn lessons from an unexpected source: those we temperamentally most despise. They have the most to teach us about how to bring about the reality we yearn for but that they are fighting against. We need weapons of similar grade steel to theirs. Ultimately, we should care more about being effective than about being nobly intentioned. It is not enough to dream well: the true measure is what we achieve. The purpose is to change the world for the better, not reside in the quiet comforts of good intentions and warm heart. All this Machiavelli knew. He disturbs us for good reason; because he probes us where we are at our most self-serving. We tell ourselves we didn't get there because we are a little too pure, good and kind. Machiavelli bracingly informs us we are stuck because we have been too short-sighted to learn from those who really know: our enemies."

    "Title": "How To Be Confident",
    "Transcript": "In well-meaning attempts to boost our confidence ahead of challenging moments, people often try to draw our attention to our strengths: our intelligence, our competence, our experience. But this can – curiously – have some awkward consequences. There's a type of under-confidence that arises specifically when we grow too attached to our own dignity and become anxious around any situation that might seem to threaten it. We hold back from challenges in which there is any risk of ending up looking ridiculous which comprises, of course, almost all the most interesting situations. In a foreign city, we might grow reluctant to ask anyone to guide us to the nice bars, because they might think us an ignorant, pitiable, lost tourist. We might long to kiss someone but never let on out of a fear that they could dismiss us as a predatory loser. Or at work, we don't apply for a promotion, in case the senior management deems us delusionally arrogant. In a concerted bid never to look foolish, we don't venture very far from our cocoon, and thereby – from time to time at least – miss out on the best opportunities of our lives. At the heart of our under-confidence is a skewed picture of how dignified it is normal for a person to be. We imagine that it might be possible, after a certain age, to place ourselves beyond mockery. We trust that it's an option to lead a good life without regularly making a complete idiot of ourselves. One of the most charming books ever written in early modern Europe is called 'In Praise of Folly' by the Dutch scholar and philosopher, Erasmus. In its pages, Erasmus advances a hugely liberating argument. In a warm tone, he reminds us that everyone, however important and learned they might be, is a fool. No one is spared, not even the author. However well-schooled he himself was, Erasmus remained – he insists – as much of a nitwit as anyone else: his judgement is faulty, his passions get the better of him, he is prey to superstition and irrational fear, he is shy whenever he has to meet new people, he drops things at elegant dinners. This is deeply cheering, for it means that our own repeated idiocies don't have to exclude us from the best company. Looking like a prick, making blunders and doing bizarre things in the night doesn't render us unfit for society; it just makes us a bit more like the greatest scholar of the northern European Renaissance. There's a similarly uplifting message to be pulled from the work of Pieter Brueghel. His central work, 'The Dutch Proverbs,' presents a comically disenchanted view of human nature. Everyone, he suggests, is pretty much deranged: here's a man throwing his money into the river; there's a soldier squatting on the fire and burning his trousers; someone is intently bashing his head against a brick wall; someone else is biting a pillar. Importantly, the painting is not an attack on just a few unusually awful people-- it's a picture of parts of all of us. Brueghel's and Erasmus's work proposes that the way to greater confidence isn't to reassure ourselves of our own dignity-- it's to grow at peace with the inevitable nature of our ridiculousness. We are idiots now, we have been idiots in the past, and we will be idiots again in the future... and that's OK. There aren't any other available options for human beings to be. Once we learn to see ourselves as already, and by nature, foolish, it really doesn't matter so much if we do one more thing that might make us look a bit stupid. The person we try to kiss could indeed think us ridiculous. The individual we asked directions from in a foreign city might regard us with contempt. But if these people did so, it wouldn't be news to us-- they would only be confirming what we had already gracefully accepted in our hearts long ago: that we, like them – and every other person on the earth – are a nitwit. The risk of trying and failing would have its sting substantially removed. A fear of humiliation would no longer stalk us in the shadows of our minds. We would grow free to give things a go by accepting that failure was the acceptable norm. And every so often, amidst the endless rebuffs we'd have factored in from the outset, it would work: we'd get a kiss, we'd make a friend, we'd get a raise. The road to greater confidence begins with a ritual of telling oneself solemnly every morning before heading out for the day, that one is a muttonhead, a cretin, a dumbbell and an imbecile. One or two more acts of folly should, thereafter, not matter very much at all."

    "Title": "Why Humanity Destroyed Itself",
    "Transcript": "One day, if human civilisation ever wipes itself out, aliens or one of our successors will cast an eye on our ruined planet, and ask themselves what ever happened to <homo sapiens>. Their answer might look a little like this. The root cause won't be the specific catastrophe, conflict or devastation that eradicates us; the problem will begin with the architecture of the human brain. This tool will be remembered for being, in part, deeply impressive, containing a 100 billion neurons capable of extraordinary computations and combinations. As aliens will note, a particular part of the mind where our most dazzling thoughts unfolded was known to neuroscientists as the neocortex; a part that in humans was many times larger than that found in any other species. This is what helped the hugely clever ape to produce The Magic Flute, Anna Karenina, Concorde and civilisation. However, our alien friends will also note that the human mind contained another component, very influential but far less impressive, known as the reptilian brain (an aggressive lustful impulsive section of machinery), with a great deal more in common with what might be found in a hyena or a small rodent. Because of this reptilian brain <homo sapiens> ended up with three grave problems: Firstly, tribalism. Humans were always on the verge of developing violent hatreds of foreigners and manifested strong ongoing tendencies to slaughter strangers in vast numbers. They could never reliably see the humanity in all members of their own kind. Secondly, <homo sapiens> was fatefully prone to short-term thinking. Even when confronted by data, it could only imagine the near-term future, a few years at best, viewing the long-term as a chimerical and unreal state. Its immediate impulses were left uncontained and worked to destroy its individual and collective future. Lastly, <homo sapiens> had an especially keen fondness for wishful thinking. Though capable of immense intellectual achievement, its mind hated to reflect on itself, it couldn't bear to submit its ideas to rational scrutiny, it preferred to act rather than think and daydream rather than plan. Having invented the scientific method, it preferred, in most cases, to not to use it. It had a narcotic desire for distraction and fantasy. It didn't want to know itself. For many generations, these three flaws were more or less endured. Certain institutions were invented to attenuate them: the law, sound government, education, philosophy, science. It worked, sort of. Humans did keep wiping out swathes of their fellows, but they didn't scupper the species as a whole. What caused the ultimate destruction was the increasing yet untrammelled power of the neocortex. This mighty tool eventually managed to capture fire, contain the elements, and give <homo sapiens> a godlike power over the planet, while the animal overall still operated with reflexes as serene and gentle as those of a hyena. The cost of its mistakes grew ever larger, its powers became uncontained while its wisdom remained intermittent and fragile. Eventually, its might outpaced its capacity for self-control; it became a nuclear armed rodent. There was one thing that might have saved humanity: love. And three varieties of love in particular: Firstly, the love of the stranger; the capacity to see the other as like oneself and worthy of the same mercy and charity. Secondly, the love of the unborn: the concern for those who do not yet exist and whom one will never know but whose lives one is shaping in the selfish present. Thirdly, the love of the truth: the strength to resist illusion and lies and square up to uncomfortable facts of all kinds. We don't need to be aliens of the future to understand all this. We can see the disaster scenario only too well right now. The fate of civilisation lies ultimately not in the law courts, at the ballot box or in the corridors of governments. It lies in our ability to master the most short-term, selfish and violent of our impulses active in the dense folds of organic matter between our ears; it lies in learning how relentlessly to try to compensate for the flawed architecture of the human mind."

So, here is a small selection of the best of Germany's extraordinary range of compound words. \"Erklärungsnot\" Literally, a distress at not having an explanation, the perfect way to define what a partner might feel when they're caught watching porn or spotted in a restaurant with the hands they shouldn't be holding. More grandly, \"Erklärungsnot\" is something we feel when we realize we don't have any explanations for the big questions of life. It's a word that defines existential angst, as much as shame. \"Futterneid\" The feeling when you're eating with other people and realize that they've ordered something better of the menu that you'd be dying to eat yourself. Perhaps you were trying to be abstemious. Now, you're just starving. The word recognizes that we spend much of our lives feeling we've ordered the wrong thing, and not just in restaurants. \"Luftschloss\" Literally, a castle in the air, a dream that's unnattainable A word suggesting that German culture is deeply indulgent about big dreams, but also gently realistic about how hard it can be to bring them off. \"Backpfeifengesicht\" A face that's begging to be slapped Generosity towards others is key but German is bracing and frank enough to acknowledge that there are also moments when it's simply more honest to realize we may have come face to face with a dickhead. \"Ruinenlust\" This word shows German at its most delightfully fetishistic and particular meaning the delight one can feel at seeing ruins. Collapsed palaces and the rubble of temples put anxieties about the present into perspective and induce a pleasing melancholy at the passage of all things. \"Kummerspeck\" Literally, \"sorrow fat\". A word that frankly recognizes how often, when one is deeply sad, there is simply nothing more consoling to do than to head for the kitchen and eat. \"Fremdschämen\" A word full of empathy that captures the agony one can feel at somebody else's embarassing, misfortune, or failing. A capacity to feel Fremdschämen is a high moral achievement and is at the root of kindness. \"Weltschmerz\" Literally, \"world sadness\". A word that acknowledges that we are sometimes sad, not about this or that thing, but about the whole basis of existence. The presence of the word indicates a culture that isn't forcely cheerful, but takes tragedy as a given. It is immensely reassuring to be able to tell a friend that one is presently lined under the duvet, suffering from Weltschmerz. \"Schadenfreude\" We're meant to be sad when others fail, but German will wisely accept that we often feel happiness, \"Freude\" at the misfortunes, the \"Schaden\", of others. That isn't because we're mean, we just feel deeply reassured when we see confirmation that life is as hard for other people as it is for us. We can thank German for having so many of the right words to bring dignity to our troubles and hopes. Learning languages, ultimately, has little to do with discovering the world per se It's about acquiring tools to help us get a clearer grasp on the elusive parts of ourselves."

    "Title": "Thoreau and Civil Disobedience",
    "Transcript": "POLITICAL THEORY THOREAU AND CVIL DISCOBEDIENCE In March 1845, the United States acquired a new president – James K. Polk – a forceful, aggressive political outsider intent on strengthening his country and asserting its pre-eminence in front of other world powers, especially Mexico and Great Britain. Within a year of his inauguration, he had declared full-scale war on Mexico because of squabbles over the Texan border, and was soon rattling his saber at Britain over the ownership of Oregon. To complete the picture, Polk was a vigorous defender of slavery, who dismissed the arguments of abolitionists as naive and sentimental. Polk was a popular president, admired by many for his gung-ho manner, but a sizeable minority of the citizenry disliked him intensely. One especially committed opponent was a writer from Massachusetts called Henry David Thoreau. Thoreau is now a canonical American literary figure, studied in every high school for his lyrical masterpiece, Walden. But there is another, more political side to Thoreau, now usually air-brushed out of the story, which came to the fore in relation to the President. Thoreau quickly realised he was opposed to everything Polk stood for: he hated what became the Mexican-American war, instinctively siding with the losing Mexican side, he was wary of Polk's squabbles with Britain and was appalled by the administration's policy of hunting down and returning runaway slaves to their masters in the South. Thoreau's anger against his President found its impassioned expression in an essay he published in 1849, now known as Civil Disobedience. At the heart of the essay is the question of what an honest citizen should do about a president he or she wholeheartedly opposes. The prevailing view was that because Polk had won a majority, those who were against him should now fall silent. It should – it was often said – be the duty of a good citizen to fold away their objections and just respect the will of the majority. But this was precisely the point Thoreau wished to probe and upturn. He suggested that true patriots were not those who blindly followed their administration. They were those who followed their own consciences and in particular, the principles of reason. Thoreau wished to redistribute prestige away from blinkered obedience towards independent thought. What marked out a noble citizen of the republic, a real American, was not – in Thoreau's view – that they respectfully shut up, but that they thought for themselves every day of an administration's life. On the basis of just this kind of independent thinking, Thoreau signalled a radical opposition to Polk's term. He denounced the Mexican-American war, the repatriation of slaves and the outlook of the government more generally. And so as to underline his opposition, Thoreau held back payment of his taxes. In July 1846, he walked into Concord, Massachusetts to get his shoes repaired and was arrested and thrown into the town's jail. Thoreau saw nothing undignified about spending some time behind bars. As he wrote: 'Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is a prison.' 'All machines have their friction,' Thoreau admitted, but when injustice is too great, you should 'let your life be a counter-friction to stop the machine.' Thoreau didn't advocate the non-payment of taxes as a rule, and in fact, a well-meaning aunt soon paid his bill. The non-payment was just one example of the many non-violent ways that a democratically elected government could and must be resisted when its actions veer into aggression and unreason. An election may settles who the president might be, but it doesn't determine that everything that president does is right or that one should simply do nothing until the next election. Above all, Thoreau hated political passivity. Sarcastically he wrote: 'There are thousands who are in opinion opposed to slavery and to the war, who yet in effect do nothing to put an end to them; who, esteeming themselves children of Washington and Franklin, sit down with their hands in their pockets, and say that they know not what to do, and do nothing.' This would not be Thoreau's his way: 'How does it become a man to behave toward this American government today? I answer, that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it.' Thoreau argued that the citizen must never just 'resign his conscience to the legislation' and put himself 'at the service of some unscrupulous man in power.' Thoreau mocked that 'most legislators, politicians, lawyers, ministers, and office-holders… are as likely to serve the devil, without intending it, as God.” Thoreau would not be such a servant. This most American of writers knew exactly whom it was right for him to serve: his own mind and conscience."

    "Title": "The Mind Body Problem",
    "Transcript": "The so-called mind-body problem is one of the greatest and most quietly painful conundrums in philosophy, and more importantly, in everyday life. The problem is rooted in the fact that in the eyes of other people, all of us are automatically and stubbornly associated with our bodies, which includes, of course, our faces. The way we look is the overwhelming factor that dictates how others assess our natures and our characters. Whatever lip service we might pay to less punitive ideologies, in the practical world, who we are is taken to be how we look. The sweet face is assumed to contain a gentle, benevolent owner; the large, red face with narrow eyes an angry and suspicious one. We trust that personal identity is indivisible from bodily form. Yet there is one dramatic exception from this rule: our own cases. When it comes to ourselves, we know, usually with considerable an ongoing sorrow that the way we look is obviously not who we are. We are profoundly aware of a large gulf between our understanding of ourselves and the suggestions emitted by our bodies. Inside we may feel tender, inspired, inquisitive, playful, and young. But the face we see in the mirror is indelibly imprinted with an atmosphere that may be stern, grave, humorless, and ever more akin to that of an insipid elderly uncle. We may bravely push the hair this way and that, or soften the appearance with the help of a slightly brighter jumper or some intrepid shoes or dab some kind of cream or powder here and there. But nothing can ever overcome the monumental injustice, to which we appear to be subject. It isn't merely that we feel unattractive: we feel something bigger: misrepresented, as if we have been forced go into the world as an ambassador for a country we don't actually really inhabit or identify with. The English essayist George Orwell once remarked that at 40, everyone has the face they deserve. This is as absurd and cruel as to suggest that everyone might have the illnesses, the income or the life, fate they deserve. No one, not even with 40 years of trying, has ever managed to change their facial appearance by an effort of the inner will so as better to reflect their identity. No one who has passionately thought of themselves as a button-nosed person over half a lifetime has ever thereby shrunk their proboscis by even a quarter of a millimetre. In fact, quite the opposite tends to happen: our characters are liable to mould themselves to the personalities implied by our faces, as a result of years of other people assuming that this must be who we are and treating us in the light of our appearance. The gentler sides of someone who looks gentle will thereby constantly be invited to the surface by the expectations and encouragement of others. The person who is routinely assumed to be a bit sly because of the slope of their eyelids may end up fitting with the prevailing story of who they are. The mind-body problem leads us to understand some of what love, in its most generous, imaginative guises, should really involve: a commitment to remember that the other is not how they appear; that their body was imposed and not chosen and that there may be a very different character trapped within their physical envelope. The writer Cyril Connolly, who struggled with his weight all his life, and felt sickened by his round full cheeks, bald head and what he termed 'accountant's expression', once wrote poignantly: 'Inside every fat man is a thin one trying to get out…' But the phenomenon shouldn't be limited to the fat-thin dichotomy. Inside a distressing number of us, there is someone else trying to get out, perhaps a mellow 65-year-old man from the body of a 25-year-old woman, or a thoughtful nerdy girl from the body of a middle-aged irritable male. The best we can do to overcome the mind-body problem is not to fiddle with our clothes, invest in hairdressers or endanger our health with plastic surgery. We will never be able properly to align mind and body, by outward sculpting. The solution is to recognise that the problem is an existential part of being human. And therefore, that we must always strive to remember, in spite of all the visual evidence, and in a spirit of love, that the bodies and faces of others are very separate from the character of their minds, in the hope that others will in time give us completely generous and kind interpretation when their gaze turns to our faces and bodies."

    "Title": "The Purpose of Friendship",
    "Transcript": "friendship should be one of the high points of existence and yet it's also the most routinely disappointing thing we have to deal with. Too often you're at supper at someone's house, there's an impressive spread and the hosts have evidently gone to a lot of trouble. But the conversation is meandering and devoid of any real interest it flits from an overlong description of the failings of the in-flight service on a particular airline to a strangely heated discussion about the tax code. The intentions of the hosts are hugely touching, but as so often we go home wondering what on earth the whole performance was really about. The key to the problem of friendship is to be found in an odd sounding place: a lack of a sense of purpose. Our attempts at friendship tend to go adrift because we collectively resist the task of developing a clear picture of what friendship might really be for. The problem is that we're unfairly uncomfortable with the idea of friendship having any declared purpose, because we associate purpose with the least attractive and most cynical of motives.  Yet purpose doesn't have to ruin friendship and in fact the more we define what a friendship might be for the more we can focus in on what we should be doing with every person in our lives, or indeed the more we can helpfully conclude that we shouldn't be with them at all. There are at least four things we might be trying to do with the people we know. Firstly, networking. It's an unfairly maligned idea. We're small, fragile creatures in a vast world. Our individual capacities are entirely insufficient to realize the demands of our imaginations. So of course we need collaborators, accomplices who can align their abilities and energies with ours. This idea of friendship was given a lot of space in classical literature. Take the Argonauts, the legendary ancient Greek tale, which traced how a heroic captain called Jason networked in order to assemble a band of friends to sail on the Arkham, in search of the Golden Fleece. Later, the same idea emerged when Jesus networked, to put together a band of twelve disciples with whom he could spread one or two world-changing ideas about forgiveness and compassion. Rather than diminish our own efforts as we hand out our business cards, such prestigious examples can show how elevated an ambitious networking friendships could ideally be. Secondly, reassurance. The human condition is full of terror. We're always on the verge of disgrace, danger and disappointment and yet, such are the rules of polite conduct that we're permanently in danger of imagining that we are the only ones to be as crazy as we know we are. We badly need friends because with the people we know only superficially, there are few confessions of sexual compulsion or of regret, rage and confusion. These superficial acquaintances refuse to admit that they, too, are going slightly out of their minds. Yet the reassuring true friend gives us access to a very necessary and accurate sense of their own humiliations and follies, insights with which we can begin to judge ourselves and our sad and compulsive lives slightly more compassionately. Thirdly, fun. Despite talk of hedonism and immediate gratification, life gives us constant lessons in the need to be serious. We have to guard our dignity, avoid looking like a fool and pass as a mature adult. The pressure can become onerous and in the end even dangerous. That's why we constantly need access to people we can trust enough to be silly with them. They might most of the time be training to be a neurosurgeon or advising middle sized companies about their tax liabilities, but when we're together we can be therapeutically daft. We can put on accents, share lewd fantasies or doodle on the newspaper, adding a huge nose and a missing front tooth to the President or giving the fashion model distended ears and masses of curly hair. The fun friend solves the problem of shame around important but unprestigious sides of ourselves. Fourthly, clarifying our minds. To a surprising degree it's very hard to think on our own. The mind is skittish and squeamish. As a result, many issues lie confused within us. We feel angry but are not sure why. Something is wrong with our job but we can't pin it down. The thinking friend holds us to the task. They ask gentle but probing questions which act as a mirror that assist us with the task of knowing ourselves. One side effect of getting a bit more precise about what we're trying to do with our social lives, is that we're likely to conclude that in many cases, we're spending time with people for no truly identifiable good reason. These proto friends share none of our professional ambitions or interests, they aren't reassuring and may indeed be secretly really very excited by the possibility of failure. We can't be catharticly silly around them and they aren't the least bit interested in furthering our or their path to self knowledge. They are, like so many of the people in our social lives, simply in our orbit as a result of some unhappy accident that we've been too sentimental to correct. We should dare to be a little ruthless in this area. Culling acquaintances isn't a sign that we've lost belief in friendship, it's evidence that we're starting to get clearer and therefore more demanding about what a friendship could really be. In the best way the price of knowing what friendship is for may be a few more evenings at home in our own company"

    "Title": "How We Lie to Ourselves",
    "Transcript": "A major obstacle to self-knowledge, and in turn to a flourishing life is the tendency of one part of our minds to lie to the other. We lie for what might initially seem like a very understandable reason, because we want to avoid pain. But in so doing, we hugely damage our chances of happiness. There are four things we particularly like to lie to ourselves about. We lie about all the problematic aspects. It would take so much effort to alter our jobs, our relationships, our friendships, our health, our habits, and ideas. We lie because we need to think well of ourselves, and devoted to imagining that we are essentially normal, without peculiar loves, hates, and deviant thoughts. We lie because we don't want to feel so inadequate. And yet because we lack so many good things. We lie because we're furious with certain people we're supposed to love. And we lie because what we furious about feels so minor and pathetically petty for a grown-up to care about. Given how risky the truth about us can feel, we had to learn to be masters of deception. Our techniques are wide-ranging, devilish, and often hugely imaginative. Here are some of the leading maneuvers we employ to pull the wool over our own eyes. Distraction/Addiction We identify something that can powerfully keep our thoughts away from troubling inner confrontations. Online pornography's a favorite. The news another. Alcohol, a third. Work, a fourth. We don't so much like these elements in and of themselves. We like them for their ability to keep us away from what we fear. Manic Cheeriness A sadness we haven't been able to admit to, is often covered up with exaggerated doses of manic cheeriness. We aren't happy, so much as incapable of allowing ourselves to feel even the slightest sadness. In case we were to be overwhelmed by our buried grief. We develop a brittle insistent tendency to say that, \"All is very well\", \"This is lovely, isn't it?\" We might press leaving no room for any ideas to the contrary. Irritability Denied anger with a particular personal situation often seeps out into a generalized irritability. So successful is the lie, we don't really know what's up. We just keep losing our tempers. Someone moved the TV remote. There are two eggs in the fridge. The electricity bill is slightly higher than we expected. Anything can set us off. Our brains are so filled with how frustrating, annoying things are. We have cleverly left no space at all for focusing on the true and very sad issue. Denigration We tell ourselves that we simply don't care about something. Love or politics, career success or intellectual life. That beautiful student or the house we can't afford. And we are very emphatic about our lack of interest and complete disdain. We go to great lengths to make it very clear to others and ourselves how absolutely unconcerned we are. Censoriousness We grow censorious and deeply disapproving of certain kinds of behavior and people. What we don't admit is that was so full of condemnation, only because we need to ward off awareness that a part of us in fact really likes the condemned element. We attack certain sexual tastes as utterly deviant and beyond the pale, precisely because we have known that we share them, somewhere inside ourselves. So we're delighted when particular people are arrested or shamed in the press. What they did was utterly awful, we insist are outraged shielding us from any risks spotting the connection between them and us. Defensiveness When there's unwelcomed news, we may resort to a highly successful diversionary tactic, taking offense. A colleague tries to give us a bit of feedback. Instantly, we accuse them of rudeness, arrogance in a sense of entitlement. A partner points something out. We get furious that they're piling pressure on us at a difficult point. Feeling offended takes up all our attention. It muddies the waters. We no longer have to pay attention to information that is it heart correct but challenging. Cynicism, Despair We're sad about particular things. But confronting them would be so arduous, we generalize and universalize the sadness. We don't say that X or Y has made us sad. We say that everything is rather terrible and everyone is rather awful. We spread the pain, in order that its particular specific causes can no longer be the focus of attention. Our sadness gets, to put it metaphorically, lost in the crowd. Why is lying to ourselves a problem? We need to tell yourself the truth when we can, for the simple reason that we often pay a very high price for the short-term calm of our lies. We miss key opportunities for growth and learning. We're not very nice to be around. We develop harmful systems. And not least, the truth will be out. When we don't let it emerge, it has a tendency to reveal itself through involuntary often physical symptoms. We become insomniac or impotent. An eyelid starts twitching. We acquire a stutter, and scream in our sleep and lose energy. We fall into depression. We owe it to ourselves to dare to start to confront our real nature."

    "Title": "Why You Can Change The World",
    "Transcript": "One of the things that separates confident from diffident people is their approach to history. Broadly-speaking, the unconfident believe that history is over; the confident trust that it's still in the process of being made – one day possibly by themselves. The way we enter the world carries with it an inherent bias towards an impression that change has finished, and history has been settled. Everything around us conspires to give off a sense that the status quo is is entrenched. We're surrounded by big people who follow traditions that have been in place for decades, perhaps centuries. The house we live in appears as immutable as an ancient temple; the school we go to looks as though it has been performing the same rituals since the earth began. We're constantly told why things are the way they are and encouraged to accept that reality is not made according to our wishes. We come to trust that human beings have fully mapped the range of the possible. If something hasn't happened, it's either because it can't happen – or it shouldn't. The result can be a deep wariness around imagining changing the world. There's no point starting a new business (the market must be full already) pioneering a new approach to the arts (everything is already set in a fixed pattern) or giving loyalty to a new idea (it either exists or is mad). When we study history in a certain way, however, the picture changes sharply. Once time is speeded up and we climb up a mountain of minutes, and survey the centuries, change appears constant. New continents are discovered, alternative ways of governing nations are pioneered, ideas of how to dress and whom to worship are transformed. Once people wore strange cloaks and tilled the land with clumsy instruments. A long time ago, they chopped the king's head off. Way back, people got around in fragile ships, ate the eyeballs of sheep, used chamber pots and didn't know how to fix teeth. We come away from all this, knowing at least in theory, that things do change, but in practice – almost without noticing – we tend to distance ourselves and our own societies from a day-to-day belief that we belong to the same ongoing turbulent narrative and are, at present, its central actors. History, we feel, is what used to happen; it can't really be what is happening around us in the here and now. Things have – in our vicinity at least – settled down. To make us braver about the idea of changing things today, we might turn to some striking lines in T. S. Eliot's cycle of poems, the Four Quartets: Winter afternoons, around 4pm, have a habit of feeling particularly resolved and established, especially in quiet English country chapels, many of which date back to the middle ages. The air in such chapels is still and musty. The heavy stone floors have been slowly worn away by the feet of the faithful. These are not places and times to think about changing the world, everything hints that we would be wiser to accept the way things are, walk back home across the fields, light a fire and settle down for quiet evening. Hence the surprise of Eliot's third line, his resonant: 'History is now and England.' In other words, everything that we associate with history – the impetuous daring of great people, the dramatic alterations in values, the revolutionary questioning of long-held beliefs, the upturning of the old order – all this is still going on, even at this very moment, in outwardly peaceful, apparently unchanging places like the countryside near Shamley Green, in Surrey, where Eliot wrote his poem. We don't see it only because we are standing far too close. The world is being made and remade at every instant. And therefore any one of us has a theoretical chance of being an agent in history, on a big or small scale. It is open to our own times to build a new city every bit as beautiful as Venice, to change ideas as radically as the Renaissance, to start an intellectual movement as resounding as Buddhism. The present has all the contingency of the past – and is every bit as malleable. It shouldn't intimidate us. How we love, travel, approach the arts, govern, educate ourselves, run businesses, age and die are all up for further development. Current views may appear firm, but only because we exaggerate their fixity. The majority of what exists is arbitrary, neither inevitable nor right, simply the result of muddle and happenstance. We should be confident, even at sunset on winter afternoons, of our power to join the stream of history – and, however modestly, change its course."

    "Title": "How to Get Over Someone",
    "Transcript": "We tend to be generous towards people who can't get over someone. It sounds romantic, if a little sad. The love affair happened a year ago but still the ex's thought remain loyal to every detail of the story. Maybe they've moved to another country. Perhaps they've married someone else. Maybe, they're dead. None of it matters. The most famous fictional love affair of the 18th century Goethe's Sorrows of Young Werther is a hugely sympathetic study of this kind of romantic fixation. The hero, Werther, an ardent young student falls passionately in love with a charming and beautiful woman named Charlotte. She likes him but doesn't love him back in part because she's married to someone else. There are plenty of other nice women who single, attractive, and interested in Werther. But, he has no time for them. The only one he cares for is Charlotte. The one who doesn't care for him. Eventually, unable to have Charlotte's love Werther decides to kill himself. The novel proved hugely charming to its original audiences. Who praised it for its deep and pure understanding of love This sort of unrequited passion so often celebrated in literature and society more generally may sound generous, and in that sense, loving, but, a devotion to an unrequited situation is in truth, a clever way of ensuring that we won't end up in a relationship at all. That we won't ever need to suffer the realities of love. Fixation on an absent other allows us to be publicly committed to love while privately sheltered from any of its more arduous demands. The fear of love maybe motivated by a range of factors A squeamishness around hope, a self-hatred which makes someone else's love feel eerie, or a fear of self revelation which breeds a reluctance to let anyone into the secret part of ourselves. The fears are serious and deserve sympathy. But they are generally not the issues that the romanticly fixated person ever wants to discuss. They prefer to keep the spotlight on the unresponsive ex, rather than on their motives for continuing to dwell on them. The way to unfixate is not to tell ourselves that we never like the person. It's to get very serious and specific about what the attraction was based on. And then to come to see that the qualities we had admired in the ex must necessarily exist in the other people who don't have the set of problems that make the original relationship impossible. The careful investigation of the character of one person, paradoxically but very liberatingly shows that we could in fact, also love someone else. This is not an exercise in getting us to give up on what we really want. The liberating move is to see that what we want has to exist in places beyond the pain enducing character we originally identified it in. We should gently recognize that being dissapointed and abandoned has its curious satisfactions. It is in an emotional sense, a very safe position to be in indeed. Yet true love isn't to be acquitted with pining for an absent figure. It means daring to engage with a truely frightening prospect. A person who is available and thinks despite our strong background supposition to the contrary that we're really rather nice. That is perhaps, the only sort of challenge that properly deserve the lyrical and grand word ROMANTIC."

    "Title": "Why We Go Cold On Our Partners",
    "Transcript": "The story of the path to coldness in love is well known: we start off full of affection for one another and then, with time, feelings fade. We start prioritizing work, we check our phones while they're speaking, we don't especially want to hear how their day went. There's a popular surface explanation for this kind of emotional frost: that people naturally get bored of one another in the same way as they get bored with everything else: the gadget that once seemed so amazing, the film they used to love. Going cold is, in this story, simply the unavoidable consequence of familiarity. But there's another explanation, dark at first, but in the end, more hopeful. The loss of interest isn't either natural, or inevitable. The boredom is something at once more complicated and more active - It exists, because we fell hurt by, angry with or scared of our partner and because we haven't found a catharthic way to tell ourselves, or them, about it. Tuning out isn't inevitable, it's a symptom of disavowed emotional distress, it's a way of coping. We're internally numbed, not just a touch bored. This can sound strange, after all we might have no active sense that our partner has been hurting, angrying or frightening us. The idea apears laughable or extreme It makes our partners sound like monsters or ourselves like weaklings, neither of which is true. But the self that loves within a relationship is not the normal, adult self we know from other zones of our lives. We may mostly be hugely resourceful and resilient, but the person who loves is an infinitely more vulnerable being. We should imagine it like a smaller, younger, more defenceless version of ourselves that lives in our heads and is no tougher and not much wiser than we were as babies, which is when so many of our needs for and ideas about love were formed It's this vulnerable self that continues to direct our hearts even if we're 6'2\" with a pointy beard. The loving self has a gossamer thin ego. It gets hurt, frightened and upset with desperate ease. You can deeply distress it by interrupting it during the story it's telling you about the sandwich it had for lunch, by not asking it enough about the little spot it got on it's arm yesterday, by preferring a book to cuddling, or being a bit tricky about which channel it should watch on TV. Of course, these are, by ordinary adult standards, tiny slights but we don't love by adult standards. These small arrows are enough to wound the self that loves to it's tender, emotional core. Ideally, of course, the small self would at once point out what's happenned, It would carefully explain that it'd been frustrated and hurt, it's voice would be measured, undefensive and charming, but mostly it just stays silent. That's forgiveable - it doesn't properly understand what's wrong, it just knows it's in pain and it's driven by an instinct to withdraw and protect itself which translates into behaviour that looks pretty cold. If the adult self had to give voice to the loving self's upset, it could sound and feel absurd, which is partly why it doesn't. There can be something especially humiliating in having to say: 'I don't feel you took enough interest in the details of my lunch break.' or 'I'm 45 years old but not capable of sharing a TV remote control'. These truly are small issues for an adult to dwell on, but the parts of us that make themselves vulnerable in love don't obey the ordinary adult rules The consequence is that the loving self dries up, it doesn't want to have sex, it gets sarcastic and irritable, but it doesn't even know why it's like this. It isn't putting on an act, it's confused. To learn to cope, we need a prominent mutual awareness and forgiveness of this dynamic of sensitivity and distress and a commitment to decode it when disengagement and indifference descend. We have  to create a forum in which so-called minor, love-sucking hurts can safely be aired without the other dismissing, as they always so easily can, the issues at stake as childish or imagined. The touchiness of the loving self is ridiculous, if judged by the more robust standards of the rest of life, but this is not the rest of life When we've gone cold, we may not truly have lost interest in our partners, we might just need an opportunity to imagine that we are quietely really rather hurt and furious with them and we should have access to a safe forum in which our tender but critical feelings can be aired, purged and understood without risk of humiliation"

    "Title": "Should We Laugh Or Should We Cry?",
    "Transcript": "Given how things are with ourselves and the world, one of the great questions we face is should we laugh or should we cry? The history of philosophy has an interesting take on the choice. Two of the greatest thinkers of ancient Greece were Democritus and Heraclitus. Both men, who lived to a very old age, had a deep knowledge of people and the world but responded to what they knew in strikingly different ways. Heraclitus couldn't stop weeping. Democritus couldn't stop laughing. It's obvious why Heraclitus cried. Once we open our eyes fully to the reality of existence it's astonishing we can ever carry on. There is simply so much to be sad about. The human animal is a benighted, deluded, uncontrolled monster, perfectly suited to the error of meanness and suffering. The greater question is how and why one would ever laugh. There is of course always the option of idiotic laugh, the plastic laugh the sentimental callous foul. But this wasn't the philosopher Democritus' way, he laughed richly and generously not because some privileged position led him to naively misunderstand how bad things could be. His good humor wasn't delusional nor was it simply a random quark of temperament. Democritus, laughed in a very particular and highly admirable style because of the way he thought about the world. He was a profound realist. He knew everything there is to know, about the human tendency to greed, murder and lust and of our constant exposure to random accident and misfortune. And ultimately Democritus was so convinced of the darkness, he knew so much about suffering and risk, he no longer felt he had to register this constantly at the front of his mind in order to do them justice. They seem to him an entirely obvious baseline fact about existence. He could be cheerful, because anything nice, sweet or charming that came his way, was immediately experienced as a bonus, a gratifying addition to an originally bleak starting point. By keeping the dark backdrop of life always in mind, Democritus sharpened his appreciation of whatever stood out against it. A pleasant thing that happened to him wasn't taken to be a feeble compensation for his larger dashed hopes. It was a delightful, slightly improbable, but very noteworthy backing of an always expected tragic trend. Democritus who's learned to enjoying parties wine and drinking. \"A life without festivity is a long road without an inn\" he wrote. He didn't believe that he had to feel constantly sad to prove that he recognized life to be sad. He danced and drunk because of a rightful confidence that he had already done justice and would in the future again have to fully do justice to the sadness of things. Democritus was aiming at an intelligent kind of cheerfulness one that admits from the outset that life is fundamentally grim but that uses this despair as a catalyst for a more vivid engagement with the beautiful or kind moments that do come ones way. Like an English person who is especially adept to drawing value from the last day of summer or a condemned man who perfectly savors the last meal before being let to the firing squad. Democritus was a master practitioner of that highly admirable state of mind: Cheerful despair. Once we've acquired the skill of cheerful despair life acquires a distinctive new kind of sweetness in all its pleasant structures. Every pain free day is a blessing. We're amazed and touched when once in a while someone seems to understand a few things we say or does something unexpectedly kind. We enjoy the distinctive cheerfulness of those who've done all the crying they can and are determined, for a while at least, to hold on to the light."

    "Title": "Why Our Partners Drive Us Mad",
    "Transcript": "The romantic story of love tells us that our search for a partner is inspired - above all else by desire to find someone, who can make us happy. But the truth is a little bit more confused and peculiar for one of the oddest aspects of love is in tracking down a mate. We don't in fact look out just for anyone who seems kind, good and attractive. We look out for someone, who will fulfill a number of pre-existing psychological requirements, which could include: subterranean appetite for frustration and humiliation. We are constrained in our love choices by what we've learned of love as children. Adult love is in central ways a search for rediscovery of emotions first known in childhood. In order to prove exciting and attractive, the partner we pick must reawoke many of the feelings we once had around parental figures. And these feelings, though they may include tenderness and satisfaction, are also likely to feature a more troubling range of emotions, perhaps a desire to prove ourselves to someone, who is always slightly skeptical of us, or feeling of shame around sexuality, or a need to cheer up someone with depressive tendencies. We can find ourselves of rejecting certain candidates in adulthood, not so much because they are wrong, as because they feel a little bit too right. That is, we dimly intuit that they're not going to make us suffer in the ways we need to suffer in order to feel that love is real. The romantic view of love suggests that we end up in bad relationships by mistake. The psychological view suggests that we end up in tricky places by unconscious intent; without being fully aware of our wish, we need our partner to have a failing that our parents once had so that we can repeat the flawed, but potent, dynamic we once had as children. Though in most cases, we're drawn to people with the very same things as a parent, occasionally a relationship pays tribute to a parent's failings in a slightly different way: we act towards our partner as our parent once acted towards us. We push the partner into the role we once inhabited as a child. We may leave our partner uncertain where they stand or deeply aware of their inadequacies. We may shout at their failures or complain of their inadequate performance in the eyes of the world. It seems we are fated either to seek out the fault of a parent in a partner or to mimic the fault of the parent with a partner. Either way, the fault of the parent is central to our love choices. Without it, we may simply not be able to feel passionate or tender with someone. We might imagine we would only be attracted to admirable traits, to perfection, to very positive things about a loved one. Yet, just below the conscious radar, it is the failings that lure us in. Because we don't automatically see what we're doing, it can be helpful to actively try to compare past and present. For example, to reflect on how a parent is feeling, and then to audit how we often feel around a partner. Correspondences can be as striking as they are humbling. We become aware of the tricky strips we're following to want to leave a relationship at once. But, this implies we might easily be able to overcome the sort of people we're attracted to. A less dramatic but still hopeful strategy is to try to deal more successfully with our compulsions within an existing relationship. What this involves is accepting the extent to which we're liable to be dealing with the issues in our couple with some of the immaturity of a child, the child we were when we first encountered the compelling flaws of our parents. We should feel sympathy for ourselves for facing a double challenge in love. We're attracted to adults who have some of the failings we knew in childhood. But then in dealing with these failings we have none of the resources, wisdom and competence that someone who had enjoyed adequate parenting in relation to them would have been able to master The failings we're most attracted to become those we're least set up to deal with We love a slightly distant person but we can't deal with the silences We're drawn to free spirits but we can't deal with the attendant anxieties In other words, our emotional legacy doesn't just involve an attraction to certain failings It also involves a style of responding to these failings that's stuck at the level of traumatized childhood. And typically involves panic, terror, cold withdrawal, projection, shame and obsessive rigidity We should untertake an unusual thought experiment To imagine the responses that an ideal, mature person might display in relation to the challenges we face. We should imagine what the mature person might do in relation to a partner who was often working or who made them feel ashamed of sex or who's career was in decline. A mature person would't be pleased or  unfazed but they would have the inner skills to  navigate the rocks calmly. They would resist jealous rages or silent sulks They would know how to wait for the right moment to deliver a point They might have the inner freedom  to make a joke out of a problem They wouldn't have to crush a weaker party Keeping such possibilities in our minds helps us to see that our own instinctive responses aren't necessary or normal They are the responses of people who underwent a lot of trouble before they had any idea of how to cope with it We should create a zone of possibility in which we can regularly imagine having a different and more constructive response to our partners audities We should accept that the way to have a better relationship is likely to lie not in firing the partner We are with them for tricky but firm reasons but in doing some internal work to learn better how to cope with the problems we face with them We can come to accept that being uncomplicatedly happy in love was never going to be our leading psychological possibility given our childhoods. But that we may gradually learn to make our peace with character traits in our partners that are as troublesome as they are compelling."

    "Title": "Why Small Pleasures Are a Big Deal",
    "Transcript": "We're surrounded by some powerful ideas about the sort of things that will make us happy. We tend to think that really to deliver satisfaction, the pleasures we should aim for need to be: Rare – we've inherited a Romantic suspicion of the ordinary (which is taken to be mediocre, dull and uninspiring) and work with a corresponding assumption that things that are unique, hard to find, exotic, or unfamiliar are naturally fitted to delight us more. Then we want things to be expensive, we like economic endorsement. If something is cheap or free, it's a little harder to appreciate; the pineapple (for instance) dropped off a lot of people's wish list of fruit when its price fell from exorbitant (they used to cost the equivalent of hundreds of pounds) to unremarkable. Caviar continues to sound somehow more interesting than chicken eggs. Then we want things to be famous, in a fascinating experiment a celebrated violinist once donned scruffy clothes and busked at a street corner and was largely ignored, though people would flock to the world's great concert halls to hear just the same man play just the same pieces. Lastly we want things to be Large Scale, we are mostly focused on big schemes, that we hope will deliver enjoyment: marriage, career, travel, getting a new house. These approaches aren't entirely wrong, but unwittingly they collectively exhibit a vicious and unhelpful bias against the cheap, the easily available, the ordinary the familiar and the small-scale. As a result: if someone says they've been on a trip to Belize by private jet we automatically assume they had a better time than someone went to the local park by bike; we imagine that visiting the Uffizi gallery in Florence is always going to be nicer than reading a paperback novel in the back garden. A restaurant dinner at which Lobster Thermidor is served sounds a good deal more impressive than a supper of a cheese sandwich at home; it feels more normal that the highlight of a weekend should be a hang-gliding lesson, rather than a few minutes spent looking at the cloudy sky; it feels odd to suggest that a modest vase of lily of the valley (the cheapest bloom at many florists) might yield more satisfaction than a Van Gogh original. And yet the paradoxical and cheering aspect of pleasure is how weird and promiscuous it proves to be. It doesn't neatly collect in the most expensive boutiques. It can refuse to stick with us on fancy holidays. It is remarkably vulnerable to emotional trouble, sulks and casual bad moods. A fight that began with a small disagreement about how to pronounce a word can end up destroying every benefit of a five star resort. A pleasure may look very minor – eating a fig, having a bath, whispering in bed in the dark, talking to a grandparent, or scanning through old photos of when you were a child and yet these pleasures can be anything but small: if properly grasped and elaborated upon, these sort of activities may be among the most moving and satisfying we can have. Appreciating what is to hand isn't a slacker's solution. It isn't an attack on ambition. But there is no point in chasing the future until and unless we are better at being more attuned to the modest moments and things that are presently or readily available to us. More fundamentally, the smallness of small pleasures isn't really an assessment of how much they have to offer us: it is a reflection of how many good things the world unfairly neglects. A small pleasure is a great pleasure in-waiting; it is a great pleasure which has not yet received the collective acknowledgment it is due. Appreciating small pleasures means trusting our own responses a little more. We can't wait for everything that is lovely and charming to be approved by others before we allow ourselves to be enchanted. We need to follow the muted signals of our own brains and allow that we are onto something important, even though others may not yet be in agreement."

    "Title": "What Do Cynical People Really Want?",
    "Transcript": "In certain quarters, cynicism has a distinct kind of glamour. It sounds pretty tough not to have too many hopes, and to claim to be able to see through the dreams of others. Cynics will tell you that everyone is selfish and weak, that the system is rigged and driven by greed, that you can never succeed, so it's pointless and contemptible to try, that all ideals are ridiculous, and the do-gooders are only out to show off their own supposed virtues. It's hopeless to try to disprove cynicism. There will always be an abundance of vivid examples to back up a catastrophic interpretation of humanity. But what identifies people as cynics, is not so much what they claim - as why they do so. The downbeat assessments are based not on a dispassionate analysis of our species, but on an inner emotional compulsion. Their philosophy is, first and foremost, a defense against suffering. Beneath that gruff surface, cynics are afflicted by a near hysterical fragility, around the idea of expecting anything, which turns out to be less impressive than they'd hoped. And so they twist their mental apparatus to secure themselves against the eventuality of any discouragement. They disappoint themselves before the world can ever do it for them, at a time and in a manner of its own choosing. Cynics may look like people trying very hard to see the facts as they are, but in truth, they are trying even harder to insulate themselves against pain. The origin of their stance is not worldly experience and insight; it is - rather more poignantly - psychological trauma. Somewhere in the past, they will probably have been a blow to their hopes that felt too powerful to handle. Sadly though cynics don't give away the slightest clue as to their touching and vulnerable backstories, they will instead talk stridently about corruption and manipulation, pile up examples of greed, and profit complex sounding theories about economics. But what they won't do, is voluntarily or easily reveal how their father humiliated them when he was drunk, or how it felt when their mother ran away to another city when they which just five. The cynic, is never truly and completely cynical. They are still recovering from hopes that grew too painful to avow. A natural temptation, when encountering a cynic, is to try to argue them out of their attitude, by citing counter-examples, but this, is in its own way cruel, because it misunderstands what cynicism is about. It is an emotional protection. In essence, a mode of coping, learned under conditions of duress. What the cynic really needs, and yet fears they may never get, so naturally never asks for, is kindness. The kindness that may eventually help them to rekindle their stunted, secret desires, for hope, and fulfillment."

    "Title": "Why Socrates Hated Democracy",
    "Transcript": "We are used to thinking very highly of democracy – and by extension, of Ancient Athens, the civilisation that gave rise to it. The Parthenon has become almost a byword for democratic values, which is why so many leaders of democracies like to be photographed there. It's therefore very striking to discover that one of Ancient Greece's great achievements, Philosophy, was highly suspicious of its other achievement, Democracy. The founding father of Greek Philosophy – Socrates – is portrayed, in the dialogues of Plato, as hugely pessimistic about the whole business of democracy. In Book Six of The Republic, Plato describes Socrates falling into conversation with a character called Adeimantus and trying to get him to see the flaws of democracy by comparing a society to a ship. If you were heading out on a journey by sea, asks Socrates, who would you ideally want deciding who was in charge of the vessel? Just anyone or people educated in the rules and demands of seafaring? The latter of course, says Adeimantus, so why then, responds Socrates, do we keep thinking that any old person should be fit to judge who should be a ruler of a country? Socrates's point is that voting in an election is a skill, not a random intuition. And like any skill, it needs to be taught systematically to people. Letting the citizenry vote without an education is as irresponsible as putting them in charge of a trireme sailing to Samos in a storm. Socrates was to have first hand, catastrophic experience of the foolishness of voters. In 399 BC, the philosopher was put on trial on trumped up charges of corrupting the youth of Athens. A jury of 500 Athenians was invited to weigh up the case and decided by a narrow margin that the philosopher was guilty. He was put to death by hemlock in a process which is, for thinking people, every bit as tragic as Jesus's condemnation has been for Christians. Crucially, Socrates was not elitist in the normal sense. He didn't believe that a narrow few should only ever vote. He did, however, insist that only those who had thought about issues rationally and deeply should be let near a vote. We have forgotten this distinction between an intellectual democracy and a democracy by birthright. We have given the vote to all without connecting it to wisdom. And Socrates knew exactly where that would lead: to a system the Greeks feared above all, demagoguery. Ancient Athens had painful experience of demagogues, for example, the louche figure of Alcibiades, a rich, charismatic, smooth-talking wealthy man who eroded basic freedoms and helped to push Athens to its disastrous military adventures in Sicily. Socrates knew how easily people seeking election could exploit our desire for easy answers. He asked us to imagine an election debate between two candidates, one who was like a doctor and the other who was like a sweet shop owner. The sweet shop owner would say of his rival: Look, this person here has worked many evils on you. He hurts you, gives you bitter potions and tells you not to eat and drink whatever you like. He'll never serve you feasts of many and varied pleasant things like I will. Socrates asks us to consider the audience response: Do you think the doctor would be able to reply effectively? The true answer – 'I cause you trouble, and go against you desires in order to help you' would cause an uproar among the voters, don't you think? We have forgotten all about Socrates's salient warnings against democracy. We have preferred to think of democracy as an unambiguous good – rather than as something that is only ever as effective as the education system that surrounds it. As a result, we have elected many sweet shop owners, and very few doctors."

    "Title": "Why Introspection Matters",
    "Transcript": "Knowing yourself sounds like a good idea but it can be hard to see quite why it should matter so much there are some clues in an old story about a lion with a sore paw a traditional folktale known as Androcles and the Lion the earliest version of the story comes from the ancient Roman philosopher Aulus Gellius and has been adapted and retold ever since one version goes like this once long ago there was a Barbary lion nine feet long with a splendid dark mane who lived in a forested foothills of the Atlas mountains in what is today Algeria usually the lion kept far from human settlements but one year in spring he started approaching the villages at night roaring and snarling menacingly in the dark the villagers were terrified they put extra guards on the gates and sent out heavily armed hunting parties to try to kill him It happened around this time that a shepherd boy named Androcles followed his sheep far into the high mountain pastures one cold evening he sought shelter in a cave he had just lit a candle and was setting his blanket on the ground when to his horror he saw the ferocious beast staring at him at first he was terrified the lion looked as if it might be about to pounce on him and rip him to pieces but Androcles notice something there was a thorn deeply embedded in one of the lion's front paws and a huge tear was running down his noble face the creature wasn't murderous it was in agony so instead of trying to flee or defend himself with his dagger the boy's fear changed to pity Androcles approached the lion stroked his mane and then gently and reassuringly extracted the thorn from the paw and wrapped it in a strip of cloth torn from his own blanket the lion licked the boy's hand and became his friend many years later Androcles got into trouble with the authorities he was shipped to Rome taken to the Colosseum and thrown before a lion to be devoured in public for the pleasure of the people and the emperor but when the lion saw Androcles he became quiet and went forward and lowered his head in a bow it was the same Barbary lion Androcles had taken pity on as a boy the emperor pardoned Androcles and he and his lion lived together in Rome and they used to go for walks together through the streets with the lion peaceable and contented led only on a slender leash the fable can be usefully be read as an allegory about self-knowledge the lion is in terrible pain but has no capacity to understand what is hurting him exactly and how he might put it right in his blind distress he acts in horrifically aggressive and threatening ways he makes blood-curdling noises and frightens everyone the lion is all of us when we lack insight into our own distress the thorn is a troubling, maddening element of our inner lives a fear a biting worry a regret a sense of guilt a feeling of humiliation a strained hope or agonized disappointment that rumbles away powerfully but just out of range of our standard view of ourselves but there's potentially another Androcles-like side of us able calmly to see past the fury to what the problem really is and then calm our untargeted anger and help us find constructive solutions however it's not always easy some of the following can happen when we try to locate the stubborn thorn we make the wrong diagnosis of what's upsetting us we're in no doubt we're in pain but we don't correctly attribute the source of the distress we lash out innocents usually the kindest people around us perhaps we start to get tetchy around our partners we accuse them of being dull and obsessed with domestic trivia and not as much fun as they once were but the thorn might in fact lie elsewhere entirely maybe there's a lovely new colleague at work and awkwardly we've developed a sort of crush on them we don't even admit to ourselves that something so unexpected and challenging might be upsetting us we don't know where to look for the thorn but others close to us who are kind, forgiving and easy targets for our frustration end up taking the blame nevertheless another option is that we try to ignore the pain when the paw hurts too much in ways we don't grasp it's tempting to try to numb our distress we search out an anesthetic that can reduce the discomfort but fails to address it's causes we might take to drinking playing nonstop game of solitaire watching porn or working obsessively the thorn is still firmly lodged in place but we notice it less and yet the numbing move extracts a high price it eats away at our time undermines our self respect or leads to debilitating symptoms we might not be able to sleep insomnia often being traceable to the turbulent impact of issues we haven't paid proper attention to during the day or finally we might apply the wrong medicine we might come up with unfounded confused schemes to solve a pain we don't understand we may take to blaming our partner the city we live in the government or our employer rifling through a cabinet of cures we might pick a journey to the desert or a quick divorce we decide to quit our jobs or sack someone it can be hard not to inflict severe pain on ourselves or others when we don't have an

    "Title": "Are You A Sleazebag?",
    "Transcript": "You spot someone out in the street of the park and by chance, see them again later. They look amazing. You hope they might smile at you, and without you even quite realizing, one side of your mind races ahead with extreme scenarios that have absolutely no place in a sensible, respectable life. It can be worrying. Are you, or even worse, are you increasingly becoming something of a sleazebag? The possibility is appalling in an era deeply alive to the dangers of unreciprocated desire, and yet, the very fact we have this worry is a good sign. To be concerned that one's desires might horrify another person is a signal of a basic moral sense. Exploitative people don't ever agonize they might be such a thing. An erotic fantasy isn't a prelude to forcing one's unsolicited attention on another person; it's a mature admission that nothing is ever going to happen. Erotic thoughts belong to a larger family of daydreams; that is, wishes that one's life were richer in possibilities than it actually is. The inventor of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, made an instructive observation about babies and daydreams. Imagine a baby who wakes up in the middle of the night. It's dark and the mother isn't there, and it starts crying. It's going to take a few minutes before the mother can come along and see what's the matter. In those few minutes, the baby is alone with its distress. To an adult, it might not seem such a long time, but to an infant, the delay could be devastating. In a healthy scenario, the baby pulls off a remarkable feat: it's able to imagine the mother being there, even when she isn't. The baby fantasizes that it's not alone, that things are better than they are, and that can be enough to hold things together for a while. Fantasy comes to the rescue when there aren't any better options about. Daydreaming is a safety net that stops us going crazy from a sense of missing out. Rather than worrying only about the risks of daydreams, we should be concerned about what happens when people can't have them. It's the inability to fantasize that may lead people to act out, rather than dream their wishes. Fantasy is a critical safety valve. It's a frank admission of the goodness and appeal of so much one hasn't got. And perhaps, we can get more ambitious about daydreams. We call them \"sleazy\" to draw attention to their unwanted, erotic component. But the act of wondering about someone else can potentially extend far beyond the body to broader daydreams about personality, character, and ultimately, a love of a whole being. When we fear we are \"sleazebags\"-- as we must, if we're decent people-- we should honor our daydreams for what they really are: melancholy, slightly pitiful, highly normal, and yet clever ways of coping."

    "Title": "POP CULTURE: What Is Cinema For?",
    "Transcript": "Cinema is the most prestigious cultural activity in the modern world. It is for us what theater was in the age of Shakespeare, or painting was in the days of Leonardo DaVinci. The art form with the biggest impact, the largest budgets, and the most widespread audiences. Collectively, we recognize that film has an astonishing power to induce emotion. But it would sound weird to stop and ask what film was really for, what purpose it serves in our societies, and why we spent so much time in its presence. We don't generally think of films are serving any very strenuous or serious cause. We ask for a lot of nice but not terribly lasting things of films, to while away the hours of a long flight, to keep the family together on the sofa, to give us a bit of a thrill. This is a great loss for us and for cinema itself. We should try to pin down more accurately what films actually do for us, then make sure we're reliably making and finding our way to see the best, that is, the most useful kinds of things. We would ideally accept that film, like all the other art forms, best reveals its power, when we conceive of it as a kind of therapy. Let's consider five key problems and how films can help us with them. We're understandably prone to self-pity. We get ground down and frustrated by the problems life throws at us, and we tend to react by getting ever more stern and serious. Certain films can beautifully address this natural tendency, when they show us people not too different from ourselves, in difficult situations, except very much unlike us. These films play our pains for laughs. They seek the absurd side, the exact things that really great with excessive seriousness. At their best, there's nothing trivial about these comedies at all. They take on the momentous task of sweetly etching us towards being slightly nicer people to live around. 2. We're not careful enough Sometimes in life, an action that seems quite small, goes on to have enormous consequences. You tell a little lie. You steal a tiny bit. You're a bit dishonest with someone. You get a bit lustful and carried away just once, and then from this, catastrophe ensues. Films can help us by speeding up time, and showing us in a matter of hours, fearsome result of what we might originally thought of as small failings. Film can push the consequences to the maximum. By witnessing horror and disaster it can make us want to be the kind of person, who is a touch more forthright, and little more honest and moral, readier to face an unpleasant moment now and (thereby) head off a distant disaster. We leave the cinema, less inclined to be self-righteous about the failings of others scared for ourselves and more respectful towards things we hold dear. It might sound odd, but it's usually very healthy and helpful, to feel that one's life is a bit special, deserving of admiration and respect, a little glamorous. But very often the opposite is the case. Glamour lies elsewhere, in the lives of the famous in swankier parts of town, in activities and jobs far removed from our own. Film has an enormous power to glamorize. It can put in front of our eyes delightful images, many meters in size, shot an extraordinary colors, vivid and immediate. Because so many films glamorize the wrong things, we used to thinking that an element of alienation and corruption is a generic, rather than incidental danger of cinema. But in fact, film is well able to show us the less obvious, but real charms of everyday life. Whereas the worst sort of films eject us back into our lives, full of longing and disenchantment, the best ones leave us ready to re-engage with circumstances, with which we had unfairly grown bored. Cinema can help us love and appreciate what we already have. It's not entirely our own fault. The media is to blame for much of it. Because it tells us about categories of people we want nothing to do with, places that seem frightening, bizarre, unremittingly depressing. We going to think we're not at all interested in people in Iran or Venezuela. Our disenchantment make it expressed as racism, arrogance, or just plain coldness. Ultimately, what we suffer from is a denial of our common humanity. Cinema can perfectly compensated for this withdrawal of emotional energy, by showing us the appeal of people far away, we'd otherwise be completely uninterested in. With the highest artistry, we're reminded of an obvious but so easily forgotten fact. Our membership of the family of humanity. We've gone so far down the track of teaching ourselves about the importance of gentleness and compromise. Many of us have unwittingly develop problems around courage and self-assertion. Decent people have learned so well to suppress their own appetite for a fight, their own desire for victory. But in a world where conflict is unavoidable, good people sometimes need to strengthen their willingness to face down opposition, not always to compromise and play it safe, but to take risks, to get out and fight, to relish victory, and to be a bit more ruthless in the service of noble and deeply important ends. Sometimes, it's not enough just to be right. You also need to win so some of us might well benefit from seeing films, that tell tales of heroism to follow someone who has to navigate the world, kill a dragon, outwit some baddies. The film shouldn't ideally leave us just in awe at the daring of another person. It should do that for most valuable thing. Educate us by example, so that we too become just a little more heroic and brave where we need to be. Cinema, as we currently know it, is not a million miles away from doing wonderful things. But in order to help with the real business of living, we need this hugely compelling and powerful art form to set out in a more determined and systematic way to offer us the help we really need. The way we categorize films should ideally get a little bit more subtle. Rather than say something was merely a thriller or comedy, we'd put the accent on what these genres might achieve for their audiences. Instead of suggesting that one needs to be above a particular age to watch a film, the government classification board would see its primary task is that of helping a film to reach the audience it could best help. Thus a film might be rated A, meaning that it was regarded as being particularly good at getting us to address and cope with anxiety. Or it could have an MC rating, meaning that it was of benefit to those experiencing marital conflict. Films can do so much for us. They better direct our feelings of sympathy. They offer comfort for our unmanageable fears. They correct an unworkable sense of what is normal. They edge us towards good conduct. They caution, and arm us against our folly and vices. We should, as society, be ready to see them as more than just entertainment. They are, at their best, guides to life and pieces of spectacular applied philosophy."

    "Title": "Why You Shouldn't Trust Your Feelings",
    "Transcript": "It's easy to grow up with a sense that our feelings are reliable guides to ourselves, the people around us, and the world at large. We can call this optimistic thesis the 'clear pane' theory of the mind, iImplying that we are able to look out onto the world pretty much as if through an undistorted, and blemish-free pane of glass. Yet a long tradition in philosophy has sought to warn us of a far trickier truth. The school of thought, known as skepticism, that began in Ancient Greece in the third century B.C. proposed that a great many of our solid-seeming sensory first impressions should not be assumed to be accurate and must instead be submitted to the laborious process of rational unscrambling. Far from our minds being clear panes, they're full of scratches, blind spots and warps. To be wise, therefore, means for the skeptics to strive to be permanently vigilant no matter how much we're inclined to misunderstand reality by trusting our first feelings. One tiny instance of our distorting minds that particularly fascinated the Greeks was a strange phenomenon that occurs when a stick is partially submerged in water. It immediately seems as if the stick angles into a \"V\" just at the point where it meets the surface. But, if we pull the stick out, we'll see that it's of course, still straight. The skeptics took this tiny example as a gateway to a vast truth: that our senses are humbling fallible. The way things appear to us is often simply not how they, in fact, really are. Skeptical ideas were to be the leading force behind the development of modern science. In the middle of the 16th century, the Polish philosopher and astronomer Capernicus demonstrated that whatever our senses might have suggested to us for hundreds of thousands of years, according to logical reasoning, the truth is that the sun does not, in fact, revolve around the earth. But the skeptics weren't only interested in the errors we fall into when doing astronomy-- they were fascinated by our tendencies to fall into error in our personal lives under the influence of our emotions. For example, our minds are seldom free of the influence of moods: a kind of emotional weather that scouts over our mental horizons normally without us having any understanding of where these moods have come from, when they might lift, or even that they exist. However, these moods can have a decisive impact on our ideas. We might in one mood consider ourselves fortunate with a bright-lit future, and feel grateful to those around us. And then, a few hours later, without anything in the outer world having changed, another mood might lead us to a whole set of re-evaluation of almost everything about us. Devilishly, part of what it means to be subject to a mood is not to realize that we are in its grip. We simply feel that our friends, who we liked quite a lot yesterday, are no good. And our job, which once offered us so much, is absurd. Tiredness can be a particularly powerful agent that silently and invisibly perverts our judgement. The 19th century skeptic, Friedrich Nietzsche, remarked, \"When we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we thought we'd conquered long ago.\" Though crucially, it's extremely rare and counter intuitive to judge that it really might be tiredness that's affecting our outlook rather than certain objective facts in the world. We are keener to conclude that we've suddenly developed a deep resentment against humanity that we urgently need to get to bed. Lust can similarly play with our judgement, leading us to see sensitivity, kindness, and a decent alternative to our current partner. But there is, in truth, just an exceptionally beautiful profile and perhaps not much else. As the German skeptical philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer, wryly concluded, \"Immediately after copulation, the devil's laughter can be heard.\" Appreciating how flawed our minds are forms the basis upon which the story on emotional skepticism is founded. This skill, defined as a cautious awareness of the misleading power of our feelings on our judgement Having surveyed the fragilities of our minds, the Ancient Greek skeptical philosophers recommended that we learn to develop an attitude of what they called \"Epoche,\" translated as \"reserve,\" or \"suspension of judgement.\" But where of our tendencies to error we were never to rush into decisions. We were to let our ideas settle so that they could be re-evaluated at different points in time and we were to be especially vigilant about the impact of sexual excitement and tiredness on the formation of our plans. For a range of historical reasons, we've collectively been extremely reluctant to recognize the benefits of emotional skepticism. The romantic movement of the 19th century bequeathed us that beguiling would often distract solution but it's our emotions that we always find us guides to the truth. But we would've gone a long way to counteract the problems of our minds if we sometimes do ourselves the honor of not listening to our feelings. Instead, waiting for some unhelpful moods to pass and accepting that we are at heart, highly viscous bags of saline solution who stare out at reality via a highly unreliable and distorted pane of glass and must therefore frequently suspend judgement, moderate our impulses, watch over our diet, and strive to get to bed early."

    "Title": "Why Are People So Nasty?",
    "Transcript": "It happens pretty much all the time: a small jabbing comment, a joke at our expense amidst a group of old friends, a line of sarcasm, a sneering assessment, a provocative comment on the Internet. These things hurt a lot, more than we're ever allowed to really admit. In the privacy of our minds, we search for explanations, but anything satisfying and soothing is usually hard to come by which is left a puzzle at the casual in humanity that circulates all around us and suspect that perhaps it's we who are somewhere deep down to blame for falling victim to it. Here is what we should actually think: a truth as basic as it is inviolable. Other people have been nasty because they are in pain. The only reason they have hurt us is because they are somewhere deep inside hurting themselves. They've been catty and derogatory and foul because they are not well. However outwardly confident they may look, however virile and robust they may appear, Their actions are all the evidence we need that they cannot in truth be in a good place. No one solid would ever need to do this. The thought is empowering because nastiness so readily humiliates and reduces us. It turns us into the small damaged party. Without meaning to, we begin to imagine our bully as potent and even somehow impressive. Their vindictiveness demeans us. But the psychological explanation of evil at once reverses the power dynamic. It's you who has no need to belittle, who is in fact a larger, steelier, more forceful party. You, who feel so defenseless, who is all along actually in power. The thought restores justice. It promises that the guilty party has after all been punished along the way. You might not have been able to write the scales personally, they left the room already or kept the conversation flowing too fast for you to protest and in any case, you're not a sort to make a fuss. But, a kind of punishment has been delivered cosmically already. Somewhere behind the scenes, their suffering of which their needs to inflict suffering on others is simply incontrovertible evidence, is all you need to know that they have been served their just desserts. You move from being a victim of crime to being an audience to an abstract form of justice. They may not be apologizing to you but they haven't escaped freely either. Their suffer is proof: they are paying a heavy price. This isn't merely a pleasant story. A person who feels at ease with themselves can have no need to distress others. We don't have the energy to be cruel unless and until we are in inner torment. Along they way, the theory gives hints at how we might when we're recovered from the blow deal with those who dealt it. The temptation is to get stern and cruel back but the only way to diminish the vicious cycle of hate is of course to address its origins which lie suffering. There is no point punching back. We much as the old prophets always told us: Learn to look upon our enemies with sorrow, pity, and, when we can manage it a forgiving kind of love."

    "Title": "Why We Sulk and How Not To",
    "Transcript": "One of the most exciting aspects of the early days of a relationship can be the sense that a lover understands us, without us needing to speak too much. With other people, we're always having to explain ourselves at length. Even when we do, they frequently struggle to grasp our drift. But a true lover, on the other hand, seems to get us almost immediately, even in the finer grained aspects of our personalities. No sooner have we tried to explain, for example, our feelings towards autumn evenings or that bit in a song we like, when the violins start to rise, that they generously step in and say \"I know, I know\", seemingly ready to confirm our every sensation and idea. This is a profoundly beautiful and exciting discovery, but it can give rise to a hugely troubling dynamic, in terms of the long term success of relationships, because the view that a good lover must intuitively understand us is, over time, one of the most dangerous suppositions, responsible for a catastrophic outbreak of sulking. Sulking is a highly distinctive phenomenon within the psychology of love. Crucially, we don't just sulk with anyone. We reserve our sulks for people we believe shoud understand us, but happen, on a given occasion, not to. We could explain what's wrong to them, of course, but if we did so, it would mean that they had failed to understand us intuitively, and therefore, that they were not worthy of love. A sulk is one of the odder gifts of love. Our incensed background belief, that a good lover should just know, explains why on the evening when they unwittingly cause us offense at a party we'll sit quiety in the car on the way home and we'll reply with a simple \"nothing\" when inquired if anything is up. and when we get home, we'll disappear straight into the bathroom and bolt the door. And when they ask again \"please, just tell me what's wrong\", we'll remain silent with our arms folded because we implicitly believe that a true lover, someone really worthy of our affection, would naturally be able to read our intentions through the bathroom panel, through our outer casing, and into the caverns of our burnt and pained souls. Sulking has its touching sides, evoking the enormous faith that we place in our partner's capacities to interpret us. But, part of becoming an adult must surely be to believe that we cannot fairly continue to expect others to read our minds if we've not previously deigned to lay out their contents through the admittedly very cumbersome medium of words. Even the most intelligent, sensitive lover cannot be expected to continue to navigate around us without a lot of patiently articulated verbal indications of our desires and intentions. Those charming, early, lucky guesses about what our lovers feel should not fool us for too long. Even in very successful relationships there's only a tiny amount that a lover should ever be expected to know about their beloved without it having been explained in language. We shouldn't get furious when our lovers don't guess right. Rather than bolting our mouths and retreating into the comfortable silence of a sulk, we should have the courage, always, to try and explain."

It can be immensely hard not to think that those who offer us love Are in some ways weak, mistaken, needy, craven or just defective It can feel a lot easier when love was unrequited when our primary preoccupation was a thrilling dread that the admired person hadn't even noticed us But now there's finally no doubt anymore It's really clear they do like us and something troubling has arisen We're feeling a bit sick We're tempted to say we got them wrong.  They can't be the admirable people we thought they were But the issue isn't really to do with them at all it lies somewhere else entirely... in our relationship with ourselves. Their affection seem suspicious, incomprehensible and a touch repulsive because at some level this isn't what we're used to. it doesn't tally with our view of ourselves. Love can be hard to receive when we're not fundamentally convinced of our own lovability. We spend our time seeking out those who can make us suffer in ways that feel familiar. And it becomes natural to assume that a kind lover has missed something And perhaps then, to try to behave in disgusting ways just to make sure they understand We're really not who they thought we were. And that they would therefore leave us in painful but somehow psychologically gratifying ways in short, how could anyone be so great if they have the bad taste to think well of someone like us? but we have to allow ourselves to entertain another option perhaps this affection we're receiving is not a sign that our kind lover is weak or wrong or has no other options perhaps it's a sign that they've seen something in us which pointedly and tragically we don't yet quite see in ourselves and have never been alowed to believe in by figures in our past that we are deserving of love. there is hope in all this Hope that we can come to trust our lovers more that we trust our own first nervous, self-destructive impulses We can interpret their love, not as a sign of their delusion or weakness, but as evidence of an inherent lovability in ourselves to which our past histories have blinded us yet to which their love and tenderness can now awaken us we don't invariably have to hold it against others when they see some point in us."

    "Title": "PHILOSOPHY - David Hume",
    "Transcript": "The 18th century writer, David Hume, is one of the world's great philosophical voices because he hit upon a key fact about human nature- that we are more influenced by our feelings than by reason. This is, at one level, possibly a great insult to our self image, but Hume thought that if we could learn to deal well with this surprising fact, we could be both individually and collectively a great deal calmer and happier than if we denied it. Hume was born in Edinburgh in 1711, to a family that was long established but far from rich. He was the second son and it was clear early on that he would need to find a job eventually, but nothing seemed to suit him. He tried law, the vocation of his father and his older brother, but soon decided that it was: \"a laborious profession, requiring the drudgery of a whole life.\" He was considered for academic posts at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow, but he didn't land either job. So, he set out to become a public intellectual, someone who would make his money selling books to the general public. It was pretty hard-going. His first book, 'A Treatise of Human Nature', for which he had the highest hopes, met with a dismal reception. \"Never literary attempt was more unfortunate than my Treatise\", he wrote. \"It fell dead-born from the press, without reaching such distinction as to even excite a murmur along the zealots.\" But Hume kept at it, realising that the blame largely lay with the way that he had expressed his ideas. And doggedly training himself to write in a more accessible and popular manner, eventually, he did find an audience. his later works: popular history books and collections of elegant essays were best-sellers of the day. As he would say, not without some pride: \"The money given me by booksellers much exceeded anything formerly known in England; I was to become not only independent but opulent.\" Humes philosophy is built around a single powerful observation: that the key thing we need to get right in life is feeling rather than rationality. It sounds like an odd conclusion. Normally we assume that what we need to do is train our minds to be as rational as possible, to be devoted to evidence and logical reasoning and committed to preventing our feelings from getting in the way. But Hume insisted that whatever we may aim for - reason is the slave of passion. We are more motivated by our feelings than by any of the comparatively feeble results of analysis and logic. Few of our leading convictions had driven by rational investigations of the facts. We decide whether someone is admirable, what to do with our spare time, what constitutes a successful career, or who to love on the basis of feeling above anything else. Reason helps a little, but the decisive factors are bound up with our emotional lives, with our passions, as Hume calls them. Hume lived in a time known as the Age of Reason, when many claimed that the glory of human beings consists in their rationality, but for Hume a human is just another kind of animal. Hume was deeply attentive to the curious way that we very often reason from not to our convictions. We find an idea nice or threatening and on that basis alone declare it true or false. Reason only comes in later to support the original attitude. What Hume didn't believe however was that all feelings are acceptable and equal. that's why he firmly believed in the education of the passions. People have to learn to be more benevolent, more patient, more at ease with themselves and less afraid of others. But to be taught these things they need an education system that addresses feelings rather than reason. This is why Hume so deeply believed in the role and significance of public intellectuals. These were people who (unlike university professors that Hume grew to dislike immensely) had to excite a passion-based attachment to ideas, wisdom and insight. Only if they succeeded would they have the money to eat. It was for this reason that they had to write well, use colorful examples and have recoursed wit and charm. Hume's insight is that if you want to change people's beliefs reasoning with them like a normal philosophy professor won't be the most effective strategy. He's pointing out that we have to try to adjust sentiments by sympathy, re-assurance, good example, encouragement and what he called \"art\". And only later, for a few determined souls, should we ever try to make a case on the basis of facts and logic. A key place where Hume made use of the idea of the priority of feeling over reason was in connection with religion Hume didn't think it was rational to believe in god. That is - he didn't think there were compelling logical arguments in favor of the existence of a deity. He himself seems to have floated between mild agnosticism (there might be a god, I'm not sure) and mild theism (there is a god, but it doesn't make much difference to me that there is). However the idea of a vindictive god, someone ready to punish people in an afterlife for not believing in him in this one, this he considered a cruel superstition. Hume's central point is that religious belief isn't the product of reason. So arguing for or against it on the basis of facts doesn't touch the core issue. To try to persuade someone to believe or not believe with well-honed arguments seemed particularly daft to Hume. This is why he was a foremost defender of the concept of religious toleration. We shouldn't treat those who disagree with us over religion as rational people who've made an error of reasoning and so need to be put right, but rather as passionate emotion-driven creatures who should be left in peace so long as they do likewise with us. Trying to have a rational argument over religion was for Hume the height of folly and arrogance. Hume was what is technically known as a skeptic someone committed to doubting a lot of the common sense ideas of the day. One of the things he doubted was the concept of what is technically called \"personal identity\". The idea that we have that we can understand ourselves and have a more or less graspable and enduring identity that runs through life. Hume pointed out that there is no such thing as a \" Core Self \" \"When I enter most intimately into what I call \"myself\",\" he famously explained, \"I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch \"myself\" at any time without a perception and can never observe anything but the perception. Hume concluded that we aren't really the neat definable people reason tells us that we are and that we seem to be when we look at ourselves in the mirror or casually use that grand and rather misleading word \" I \". Yet, despite being skeptical of temper Hume was very happy for us to hold onto most of our common-sense beliefs because they are what help us make our way in the world Trying to be rational about everything is a special kind of madness. Hume was making a slight dig at Descartes. The French philosopher had died 60 years before Hume was born. But his intellectual influence was still very much alive. He had argued that we should throw out every fruit of the mind that wasn't perfectly rational. But Hume proposed that hardly anything we do is ever truly rational And yet he ventured that most beliefs are justified simply because they work They're useful to us. They help us to get on with what we want to do. A test of a belief isn't its provable truth but its utility Hume was offering a corrective which we sometimes badly need to our fascination with prestigious but not actually very important logical conundrums In opposition to academic niceties he was a skeptical philosopher who stood for common sense Championing the everyday and the wisdom of the unlearned and the ordinary. Hume took a great interest in the traditional philosophical topic of Ethics A conundrum of how humans can be good. He argued that morality isn't about having moral ideas It's about having been trained from an early age in the art of decency through the emotions Being good means getting into good habits of feeling. Hume was a great advocate of qualities like wit, good manners and sympathy because these are the things make people nice to be around outside of any rational plan to be good. He was hugely struck by the fact that a person and here again, he was thinking of Descartes could be ostensibly rational and yet, not that nice. Because being able to follow complex argument or deduce trends from data doesn't make you sensitive to the sufferings of others or skilled at keeping your temper. These qualities are the work of our feelings So, if we want people to behave well, what we need to do is to rethink education We have to influence the development of feeling We have to encourage benevolence, gentleness, pity and shame through the seduction of the passionate sides of our nature, without delivering dry, logical lectures. Hume's philosophy always emerged as an attempt to answer a personal question. What is a good life? He wanted to know how his own character and that of those around him could be influenced for the best. And oddly, for a philosopher, he didn't feel the traditional practice of Philosophy could really help. Though he was scholarly, he was in large part, a man of the world. For some years, he was an adviser to the British ambassador in Paris who welcomed his shrewd wisdom. He was much liked by those around him, known by the French as 'Le Bon David', a humane, kind and witty conversationalist, much in demand as a dinner companion. he insisted. That's the way Hume lived. Not in the intellectual seclusion of a monastery or ivory tower, But deeply embedded in the company of other humans, dining. He especially liked roast chicken, chatting about love and career and playing Backgammon. Hume died in Edinburgh in August 1776, at home, in his house in St. Andrew's Square His doctor wrote about the last hours to Adam Smith, for many years, Hume's best friend. Hume remains a rather outstanding thing. A philosopher, alive to how much Philosophy can has to learn from common-sense."

    "Title": "HISTORY OF IDEAS - Consumerism",
    "Transcript": "For most of history,  the overwhelming majority of the Earth's inhabitants have owned, more or less, nothing. The clothes they stood up in, some bowls, a pot and a pan, perhaps a broom and, if things were going really well, a few farming implements. Nations and peoples remained consistently poor. Global GDP did not grow at all from year to year: the world was an aggregate as hard up in 1800 as it had been at the beginning of time. However, starting in the early 18th century, in the countries of north-western Europe, a remarkable phenomenon occurred. Economies began to expand and wages to rise. Families who'd never before had any money beyond what they needed just to survive found they could go shopping for small luxuries: a comb or a mirror, a spare set of underwear, a pillow, some thicker boots or a towel. Their expenditure created a virtuous economic cycle. The more they spent, the more business grew, the more wages rose. By the middle of the 18th century, observers recognised that they were living through a period of epochal change that historians have since described as the world's first consumer revolution. It was in Britain where the changes were most marked: enormous new industries sprang up to cater for the widespread demand for goods that had once been the preserve of the very rich alone. In England's cities you could buy furniture from Chip 'n' Dale, Hepplewhite and Sheraton pottery from Wedgewood and Derby, cutlery from the smitheries of Sheffield and hats, shoes and dressed featured in the best selling magazines like The Gallery of Fashion and The Ladies Magazine. Styles for clothes and hair which had formerly gone unchanged for decades now altered every year often in extremely theatrical and impractical directions. In the early 1770s, there was a craze for decorating wigs so tall that their tops could only be accessed by standing on a chair. It was fun for the cartoonists. So vivid and numerous were the consumer novelties that the austere Dr. Johnsons Riley wondered whether prisoners were also soon to be hanged in a new way. The Christian Church looked on and did not approve. Up and down England, clergymen delivered bitter sermons against the new materialism. They called it vanity, which was a sin. Sons and daughters ought to be kept away from shops God would not look kindly on those who paid more attention to household decoration than the state of their souls. But there now emerged an intellectual revolution that sharply altered the understanding of the role of vanity in an economy. In 1723, a London physician called Bernand Mandeville published an economic tract titled \"The Fable of the Bees\" which proposed that contrary to centuries of religious and moral thinking, what made countries rich and therefore safe, honest, generous, spirited and strong was a very minor, unelevated and apparently undignified activity: shopping for pleasure. It was the consumption of what Mandeville called fripperies: hats, bonnets, gloves, butter dishes, soup tureens, shoehorns and hair clips that provided the engine for national prosperity and allowed the government to do in practice what the church only knew how to sermonise about in theory: make a genuine difference to the lives of the weak and the poor. The only way to generate wealth, argued Mandeville, was to ensure high demand for absurd and unnecessary things. Of course no one needed embroidered handbags, silk lined slippers or ice creams but it was a blessing that they could be prompted by fashion to want them, for on the back of demand for such trifles, workshops could be built, apprentices trained and hospitals funded. Mandeville shocked the audience with the starkness of the choice he placed before them: a nation could either be very high-minded, spiritually elevated, intelectually refined and dirt poor or a slave to luxury and idle consumption and very rich. Mandeville's dark thesis went on to convince almost all great Anglophone economists and political thinkers of the 18th century. There were, nevertheless, some occasional departures from the new economic orthodoxy. One of the most spirited and impassioned voices was that of Switzerland's greatest philosopher, Jean Jacques Rousseau. Shocked by the impact of the consumer revolution on the manners and atmosphere of his native Geneva, he called for a return to a simpler, older way of life. of the sort he had experienced in the alpine villages or read about in the travellers' accounts of the native tribes of North America. In the remote corners of Appenzell or the vast forests of Missouri there was, blessedly, no concern for fashion and no one upmanship around hair extensions. Rousseau recommended closing Geneva's borders and imposing crippling taxes on luxury goods so that people's energy could be redirected towards non-material values. He looked back with fondness to the austere, martial spirit of Sparta. However, even if Rousseau disagreed with Mandeville, he did not seek to deny the basic premise behind his analysis. It truly appeared to be a choice between decadent consumption and wealth on one hand and virtuous restraint and poverty on the other. It was simply that Rousseau, unusually, preffered virtue to wealth. The parameters of this debate have continued to dominate the economic thinking ever since. We re-encounter them in ideological arguments between capitalists and communists and free marketeers and environmentalists. But for most of us, the debate is no longer pertinent: we simlply accept that we will live in consumer economies, with some very unfortunate side effects to them: crass advertising, foodstuffs that are unhealthy for us, products that are disconnected from any reasonable assessment of our needs. All this in exchange for economic growth and high  employment. We have chosen wealth over virtue. an irony laden acceptance of this dichotomy is what underpins the approach of many pop artists in mid 20th century America. For example,  Claes Oldenburg developed a reputation for taking modern consumer items, many of them food related and reproducing them at enormous scale, usually in outdoor settings in vibrant polyester vinyl. In city squares, where one once might have expected to find statues in honour of political leaders or religious saints, one now came across outside hamburgers, giant cheesecakes, fries decked with ketchup or perhaps Oldenburg's most famous work a 12 meter high stainless steel, inverted ice cream cone. Oldenburg's vast versions of small things playfully directed our attention to the peculiar dependence of modern economies on the mass consumption of what are, in human terms, some deeply negligible products. Yet the scale of Oldenburg's objects was only superficially absurd. because it rather precisely reflected their actual importance in our collective economic destinies. Nevertheless, as Oldenburg seemed to concede, it was peculiar to be living in a civilisation founded on the back of buns and sweetened tomato paste, a benthos hinted at by the deflated appearance of many of the giant burgers, hotdogs and pizzas. The one question that's rarely been asked is whether there might be a way to attenuate the dispiriting choice, to draw on the best aspects of consumerism on one hand and high-mindedness on the other, without suffering their worst sides: moral decadence and profound poverty. Might it be possible for a society to develop that allows for consumers spending and therefore provides employment and welfare yet of a kind directed at something other than vanities and superfluities? Might we shop for something other than nonsense? In other words, might we have wealth and a degree of virtue? It is this possibility of which we find some intriguing hints in the work of Adam Smith an 18th century economist, too often read as a blunt apologist for all aspects of consumerism. but in fact, one of its more subtle and visionary analysts. In his book The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, Adam Smith seems at points willing to concede to key aspects of Mandeville's argument: consumer societies do help the poor by providing employment based around satisfying what are often rather sub-optimal purchases. Smith was as ready as other economists to mock the triviality of some consumer choices while admiring their consequences. All those embroidered lace handkerchiefs, jewel snuff boxes and miniature temples made of cream for dessert they were flippant, he conceded, but they encouraged trade, created employment and generated immense wealth and could be therefore firmly defended on this score alone. However, Smith held out some fascinating hopes for the future. He pointed out that consumption didn't invariably have to involve the trading of frivolous things. He had seen the expansion of the Edinburgh book trade and knew how large a market higher education might become. He understood how much wealth was being accumulated through the construction of the Edinburgh's extremely handsome and noble New Town He understood that humans have many higher needs that require a lot of labour, intelligence and work to fulfill but they lie outside of capitalist enterprise as conceived off by realists like Bernard Mandeville. Among these are need for education, for self understanding, for beautiful cities and for rewarding social lives. The ultimate goal of capitalism, in Adam Smith's view, was to tackle happiness in all its complexities psychological and not just merely material. The capitalism of our times still hasn't entirely come around to resolving the awkward choices that Bernard Mandeville and Jean Jacques Rousseau circled. But the crucial hope for the future is that we may not forever need to be making money off rather exploititive, silly or vain consumer appetites. That we may also learn to generate enormous profits from helping people as consumers and producers in the truly important and ambitious aspects of their lives. The reform of capitalism hinges on an odd sounding but critical task: a new kind of consumerism. The conception of an economy focused around buying and selling services and goods focused on our higher needs."

    "Title": "The REAL Political Divide",
    "Transcript": "We're used to dividing how people vote in elections according to the categories of right-wing and left-wing. But there might be another way of labelling an electorate that taps into something broader and deeper in human personality. We might apportion people into the camps of Romantic and Classical voters. Which might you be? Here is some of what separates these two fundamental electoral types. The Romantic believes that a far better world could be just around the corner, if only bold and swift action could be taken: if we entered an agreement or scrapped an agreement, started a war or ended a war. The Romantic considers a degree of impatience to be a vital resource in governing a nation. They may not think too badly of anger either, so long as it's handled correctly. You can be too forgiving, after all. The Romantic is excited by how things might ideally be, and always judges what currently exists in the world by the standard of a better imagined alternative. Most of the time, the current state of things arouses them to intense disappointment as they consider the injustices, prevarications, compromises, and timidity of almost everyone in government. For their part, the Classical voter is highly distrustful of sudden gestures and actions. They pay special attention to what can go wrong. They are very concerned to mitigate the downside. They are aware that most things could be a lot worse. Before condemning a policy, they consider the standard of policy across history and may regard a current arrangement as bearable, under the circumstances… Their view of people is fundamentally rather dark. They believe that everyone is probably slightly worse than they seem. They feel humans have deeply dangerous impulses, lusts and drives, and believe the task of politics is to try to contain them – rather than liberate genius, strength, beauty or benevolence. High ideals make them nervous: they are led by a desire not to make anything worse. Insofar as they hope for improvement, it is in a cautious, modest way. They dare to suppose that the world may be a marginally better place – in 300 years time. Romantics see a lot that is wrong with the world and feel confident about analysing who might be to blame for it: perhaps this particular social group or that class… A problem can't just be no one's fault – and therefore the task of politics is to identify the wrongdoers and respond appropriately. Romantics feel a basic trust in their own capacity for purity: they are sure they would be unable to be as shabby as their enemies – whom they can therefore attack with a relatively clean conscience. Classical voters also notice what is wrong, but are highly aware of their own capacity for sinfulness and error which makes them hesitant about apportioning blame. They recognise how easily they might have been active wrongdoers if circumstances had been different and suppose that no one has a monopoly on righteousness. They would suggest that evil is pretty proportionately distributed across all groups and classes – and that a priority is therefore for us to tolerantly cut each other slack at every turn. 3. Romantic voters believe that everything great in history is the result of talented individuals taking destiny into their hands and struggling against the inertia and conservatism of the mass and, most importantly, of institutions. Classical voters are deeply worried by the possibility of lone actors taking matters into their hands and, through natural weaknesses which all of us – even the most intelligent – are afflicted by, creating disaster. They are therefore on the side of legally grounded, extremely slow-moving institutions that are designed to restrain individual power and contain the capacity of any one person to shift the direction of the group too quickly. Romantic voters believe it is possible to understand a situation or issue so clearly, one can be sure of complete justice and rightness. Therefore, those who don't agree don't have to be listened to politely. They are evidently wrong – and can be silenced or sidelined as required. Classical voters are extremely alert to the possibility of error in their own and others' analyses of policy. They are therefore committed to hearing and tolerating dissenting views – in which they suspect a portion of the truth may always be lodged. Romantic voters feel that the best way for a nation to be safe in the world is for it to seem prominently 'strong'. Classical voters feel that the best way to be safe in the world is to be thought well of; and will therefore avoid actions that could upset, alarm or confuse neighbours. They're aware of how easily strength arouses the desire of others to be equally strong back. They suspect the best way to proceed might be to train in private for the worst – but extend a hand of friendship at every public turn. Both Romantic and Classical political orientations have important truths to impart. Neither is wholly right or wrong. They need to be balanced. And none of us are in any case ever simply one or the other. But because a good political landscape requires a judicious balance of both, at this point in history, in many countries, it might be the Classical electoral attitude whose distinctive claims and wisdom we need to listen to most intently and which is most ripe for rediscovery."

    "Title": "POP CULTURE: Why Music Works",
    "Transcript": "One of the most calming things that societies have ever devised is the lullaby. In almost every culture there has ever been, mothers have rocked and sung their babies to sleep. A humbling point that a lullaby reveals is that it's not necessarily the words of a song that make us feel more tranquil. The baby doesn't understand what's being said but the sound has its effect all the same. The baby is showing us that we are all tonal creatures long before we are creatures of understanding. As adults, we grasp the significance of words of course, but there remains a sensory level which cuts through and affects us far more than an argument or idea ever could. The musician can, at points, trump anything the philosopher might tell us. Ancient Greek mythology was fascinated by the story of the famous musician Orpheus. At one point he had to rescue his wife from the underworld. To get there he needed to make his way past Cerberus the ferocious three-headed dog who guarded the entrance to the land of the dead. Orpheus was said to have played such sweet, enchanting music that the wild beast calmed down and became – for a while – mild and docile. The Greeks were giving themselves a reminder of the psychological power of music. Orpheus didn't reason with Cerberus, he didn't try to explain how important it was that he should be allowed to pass, he didn't speak about how much he loved his wife and how much he wanted her back. Cerberus was – as we ourselves are at times of distress – pretty much immune to reason. But he was still open to influence. It was just a matter of finding the right channel to reach him. When we feel anxious or upset, kindly people sometimes try to comfort us by pointing to facts and ideas: they try to influence our thinking and – via careful arguments – to quieten our distress. But, as with Cerberus, the most effective way to deal with the problem may simply be to play us some music. We might need to be quietened and made mild (by a lullaby, a Chopin prelude or something by Natalie Merchant), before we are in any position to listen to reason. Music is the greatest mood adjustor we have ever invented. Its benefits can be broken down as follows: Music can reunite us with feelings we need but have lost touch with. It reconciles us to a sadness within, which we have had to be too be brave and stoic not to feel. It is the axe that breaks the frozen sea within us. Music can lend dignity to our sorrows, framing and containing what might otherwise be unmanageable grief. Music is there for us like a comforting parent in moments of despair. Music returns us to life, gently nudging us to return to the side of generosity and hope. We can follow in music's grooves of confidence, when our own will is sagging. Music is there to take us beyond the everyday, to transcend the ordinary and survey ourselves from a lofty height. Music reconnects us with our instinctual, bodily selves when reason, logic and discipline are in danger of crushing us. Music breaks down the barriers between strangers – urging us to see what we have in common, rather than what divides us. We fully discover our debt to music when we can acknowledge just how powerless we sometimes are to change our moods through reason alone. A good life doesn't only need a library of ideas: it requires a vast and ever-changing playlist that can systematically tug us back to our more hopeful, sensitive and resilient selves."

    "Title": "The Dangers Of Being Dutiful",
    "Transcript": "We start off in life being very interested in pleasure and fun. In our earliest years, we do little but hunt out situations that will amuse us, pursuing our hedonistic goals with the help of puddles, crayons, balls, teddies, computers and bits and pieces we find in the kitchen drawers. As soon as anything gets frustrating or boring, we simply give up and go in search of new sources of enjoyment – and no one appears to mind very much. Then, all of a sudden at the age of 5 or 6, we are introduced to a terrifying new reality: the Rule of Duty. This states that there are some things, indeed many things, that we must do not because we like or see the point of them, but because other people, very intimidating authoritative people who may be almost three times our size, expect us to do them – in order, so the big people sternly explain, that we'll be able to earn money, buy a house and go on holiday about 30 years from now. It sounds pretty important – sort of. Even when we're home and start crying and tell our parents that we just don't want to do the essay for tomorrow, they may take the side of Duty; and speak to us with anger and impatience – beneath which there is simply a lot of fear – about how people who can't complete a simple homework assignment on volcanoes (and want to build a treehouse instead) will never survive in the adult world. Questions of what we actually enjoy doing, what gives us pleasure, still occasionally matter in childhood, but only a bit. They become matters increasingly set aside from the day-to-day world of study, reserved for holidays and weekends. A basic distinction takes hold: pleasure is for hobbies, pain is for work. It's no wonder that by the time we finish university, this dichotomy is so entrenched, we usually can't conceive of asking ourselves too vigorously what we might in our hearts want to do with our lives; what it might be fun to do with the years that remain. It's not the way we've learnt to think. The rule of duty has been the governing ideology for 80% of our time on earth – and it's become our second nature. We are convinced that a good job is meant to be substantially dull, irksome and annoying. Why else would someone pay us to do it? The dutiful way of thinking has such high prestige, because it sounds like a road to safety in a competitive and alarmingly expensive world. But the Rule of Duty is actually no guarantee of true security. Once we've finished our education, it in fact emerges as a sheer liability masquerading as a virtue. Duty grows positively dangerous. The reasons are two-fold. Firstly, because success in the modern economy will generally only go to those who can bring extraordinary dedication and imagination to their labours – and this is only possible when one is, to a large extent, having fun. Only when we are intrinsically motivated are we capable of generating the very high levels of energy and brainpower necessary to stand out from the competition. Work that has been produced merely out of duty will be limp and lacking next to that done out of love. The other thing that happens when our work is informed by our own sense of pleasure is that we get more insightful about the pleasures of others – that is, of the clients and customers a business relies upon. We can best please our audiences when we have mobilised our own feelings of enjoyment. In other words, pleasure isn't the opposite of work; it's a key ingredient of successful work. Yet we have to recognise that asking ourselves what we might really want to do – without any immediate or primary consideration for money or reputation – goes against our every, educationally-embedded assumption about what could possibly keep us safe – and is therefore rather scary. It takes immense insight and maturity to stick with the truth: that we will best serve others – and can make our own greatest contribution to society – when we bring the most imaginative and most authentically personal sides of our nature into our work. Duty can guarantee us a basic income. Only sincere, pleasure-led work can generate sizeable success. When people are suffering under the rule of duty, it can be helpful to take a morbid turn and ask them to imagine what they might think of their lives from the vantage point of their deathbeds. The thought of death may usefully detach us from prevailing fears of what others think. The prospect of the end reminds us of an imperative higher still than a duty to society: a duty to ourselves, to our talents, to our interests and our passions. The death-bed point of view can spur us to perceive the hidden recklessness and danger within the sensible dutiful path."

    "Title": "How to Replace the 10  Commandments",
    "Transcript": "The Ten Commandments maintain an extraordinary hold on our imaginations even though many of them can sound – in the context of our own times – really rather peculiar, with injunctions not to covet a neighbour's livestock or to make sure one doesn't carve images of god-like figures in the rocks. The Commandments were responses to the specific needs of a small nomadic community, wandering the Sinai peninsula with goats and sheep around 1,200 BC. Our needs have, predictably, changed a bit since then. But a place for rules remains: because we're still horribly prone to violence, cruelty and self-righteousness and need regularly to be reminded of how to live peacefully and well with ourselves and our neighbours. What would it be like to try to update the commandments for our own times? Here is a go... The good person is at all times highly aware of their flaws and committed to becoming a better version of themselves. They are not insulted if people point out their need for evolution, even when they do this rather clumsily. A good person believes in ongoing need for moral and phsycological education.. The good person knows that everyone is deeply damaged and a little mad, starting with (of course) themselves. They are unfrightened by their own strangeness and are committed to informing those around them of it in very good time, and apologising retrospectively when they have failed to do so. They understand that part of their duty is to have a ready answer to the legitimate question, 'And how are you crazy?' The good person is loyal in relationships not because they think their lover is perfect, but because they know that everyone is pretty imperfect and rather hard to live with at close range. They accept that the only people we can ever think of as normal or easy are people we don't yet know very well. The good person knows that it is impossible to be wholly understood by anyone and accepts that things are going well if one is very lonely in around only half of the key areas of one's life. The good person tries hard never to assume that other people should know what they are thinking of or want without them having told them very clearly and kindly. They try to resist sulking (behaviour that stems from an incensed belief that others should know why we are upset without us having  told them) and are committed to teaching others about the contents of their minds. The good person looks at people who are behaving badly as if they might be small children; that is with patience, charity and an active search for mitigating circumstances. Though our societies stress the insult of being treated as younger than one is, the good person knows it is the greatest privilege for anyone to look beyond the apparently strong yet nasty adult to the worried, anxious and probably really rather nice child within. Confronted with a piece of stupidity or evil which they could never be guilty of, the good person doesn't fall into self-righteousness. They swiftly remember all the many stupid and evil things they have at other points, over different things, been guilty of. They don't lose sight of how much they overall stand in need of the charity and forgiveness of others. The good person is committed to searching for the funny side of people who might appear merely desperately irritating. They look at others like characters in a comedy rather than a tragedy. They know that the greatest achievement is to be able to move from seeing someone as an 'idiot' to considering them as that most privileged of beings: a 'loveable idiot.' The good person is a firm believer in restraint and in not immediately saying certain things that are on their minds. They hold that being fully oneself entails a level of melodrama and rage that one should spare any human one cares about. The good person knows that the best protection against impatience and paranoia is a little gently-worn pessimism. They budget for disappointment far ahead of time. They don't cry constantly only because they have understood that the whole of existence is – in many ways – worthy of tears. Their constant awareness of the possibility of death and catastrophe makes them especially appreciative of small things that happen to go well. They relish flowers, balmy skies and so-called 'boring days' when everyone manages to go to bed relatively content and at peace."

    "Title": "What is the Stream of Consciousness?",
    "Transcript": "One of the hardest things to describe or to be properly aware of is what it feels like to be inside our own minds. The second-by-second flow of images, words, feelings and sounds inside our heads that philosophers call: our Consciousness. All day, this consiousness is filled with a tangle of material that flashes by an observing eye so fast and in so multi-layered and dense array; we can generally only rest and focus on a minuscule part of what is before us. There are waves of sensations, fog-banks of moods, collisions of ideas and swirls of associations and impressions. Consciousness doesn't just unfold on a single cinema screen of the mind either. We can think of it more like a multi, multi-plex where a dozen or more moods and emotions are projected at once in a fractured collection of images, reminiscent of a puzzling collage of Avant Garde videos. Most of what we have felt and have been, will disappear before it can ever be held and examined. Furthermore, little of the richness of consciousness ever makes it out into public discussion. When we open our mouths and tell other people, for example: what we think or how we're feeling. We have no option but to radically simplify the nature of experience like a journalist filing a 100 word piece on a battle or political revolution to an indifferent, domestic audience a continent away. We might say we've had a \"quiet day so far\" or are \"fairly cheerful at the moment.\" And a generous social code means we don't remind one another of what an inaccurate portrait this must necessarily be. Part of the reason why we're not quite aware of the true nature of consciousness is the fault of literature. In most of the novels we read, characters are attributed an utterly implausible, yet superficially beguiling, clarity of mental functioning. For example: the influential, 19th Century, English novelist: Anthony Trollope, liked to offer his readers a snapshot of what was supposed to be going on in his characters' heads. In his novel: Phineas Finn, a man is elected to parliament and Trollope describes him travelling by train to the capital to take up his post and musing moodily on his political prospects. He had many serious, almost solemn thoughts on his journey to London. He wondered if he would make a failure of the great matter he had taken in hand. He could not but tell himself that the chances were twenty to one against. Now that he looked at it, the difficulties loomed larger than ever! Trollope gives us the sincere impression that this really is how human beings think when they sit down on trains and consider their futures. The sort of novels that Trollope wrote have even been described as extremely \"realistic\". And yet the problem is that, of course, no human who has ever existed, actually thinks or feels remotely like this. It took until the early 20th Century of writers to focus on and respond to this foreshortening. In 1918, in his great novel Ulysses, the Irish writer James Joyce, for the first time, made the move of putting a kind of microphone inside his characters' minds to pick up on what became known as: 'The Stream of Consciousness'. It sounded radically different from anything Trollope or past novelists had ever described. At one point in Ulysses, we hear the stream of consciousness of a heroine Molly as she lies in bed beside her husband Bloom in the middle of the night. Is he dreaming? Am I in it? He smells of some kind of drink not whiskey perhaps the sweety kind of paste they put posters up with. I'd like to sip green and yellow expensive drinks staged or Johnny's drink. I tasted one with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel. He must have eaten oysters. I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel fuller. What's the idea of making us like that with a big hole in the middle. I hate people who come at all hours, answer the door and you're all undressed. We come to know more about our own consciousness via Joyce's unusual portrait of Molly's. Like ours, Molly's mind moves extremely fast from one topic to another. At one moment she's thinking about liqueurs, then about an American she met at the theter then a second later she's wondering if her husband's been eating oysters. Then she thinks about his penis. Then she wonders about her own body. Then gets irked by the idea of people coming around to the house when she's not ready to open the door. There's no dominant central theme that gets carefully explored. Despite the monstrous complexity, Ulysses, arguably, still amounts to a radical simplification of the true nature of experience. After all, the novel exists only as words, wheras our real stream of consciousness includes a disjointed and random streaming of films and pictures. Images constantly flit across consciousness. Sometimes we'll see something extraordinarily specific, a door handle from 27 years ago or an image of a boat on a canal in Western France or remember looking out of a train on a journey through Germany, but there'll be no further details or real sense as to why this has come into our heads right now. Nevertheless, Joyce's work is hugely significant because it helps us to start to see what we're up against when we try to understand our own minds. It is not a case of just opening up a hatch and finding a welter of well-formulated thoughts. When we turn our attention to ourselves, we won't be able to locate crystalline attitudes and precise ideas. We will discover only chaos and illusive thoughts. More significantly, it's from this prime-evil mulch, that we will have to assemble the solid and serious plans we need to navigate through existence. We have to decide: What we care about? How we should direct our lives? Who we should try to be? Knowing more about the stream of consciousness prepares us for the work that we have to do to pull out from the stream, the decent and accurate thoughts we need. The mind won't automatically yield clear answers when we ask ourselves what we think or where we might direct our energies. There can naturally be a temptation to avoid the hard work and there are some alternatives to proper introspection. Some of the content we hold in our minds is coherent and very easy to grasp, but it suffers from a marked draw-back: it isn't really ours. It's second-hand, stale and a derivative bank of ideas and plans. We have certain notions in our heads that come, not from our deeper resources of feeling and intuition but from what we have sucked in uncritically from outside from what we've read in the newspaper or heard about from parents or friends. These are: our received ideas. We don't need to think hard at all to regurgitate them. They're just waiting in prepackaged form in the reception room of our minds. An yet, it's only the thoughts and feelings that are originally unprocessed that come from the caverns in ourselves that are the ones richest in information. Even if they're also, painfully, the hardest to make sense of. Knowing a little more about the stream of consciousness shows us that our brains are a more delicate, messier organ than we're normally allowed to imagine. Many of the introspective tasks we set ourselves turn out to be more fiddly and are going to need more resources than we typically allow for. Yet the rewards for mastering introspection correctly are immense. For it's by becoming experts in our own streams of consciousness that we have the chance truly to understand who we are. and thereby to align our lives with the way we really feel and with the goals that can truly satisfy us when we reach them."

    "Title": "Love And Self-Love",
    "Transcript": "One of the great and slightly strange dangers of falling in love with someone is how we may respond the day they start to love us back. Some of the reasons we fall in love with people is because we long to escape from ourselves into the embrace of a person who appears as beautiful, perfect and accomplished as we feel ourselves to be flawed, dumb and mediocre. But what if such a being were one day turn around and love us back? Nothing could discredit them faster. How could they be as divine as we'd hoped for when they have the bad taste to approve of someone like us? It turns out that one of the central requirements of a good relationship is a degree of affection for ourselves; built up over the years, largely in childhood. We need a legacy of being deserving of love in order not to respond very obtusely to the affections granted to us by adult partners. Without a decent amount of self-love, the love of another person will always prove sickening and misguided – and we will self-destructively – though unconsciously – set out to repel or disappoint it. It will simply feel more normal and therefore comfortable to be disliked or ignored when that is mostly what we have known. If we are not wholly convinced of our own lovability, receiving affection can appear like being bestowed a prize for an accomplishment we don't feel we ever earned. People unfortunate enough to fall in love with self-hating types must brace themselves for the recriminations due to false flatterers. There is an old joke made by Groucho Marx about not deigning to belong to a club that would accept someone like him as a member. We laugh at the Marxist position because of its absurd contradictions: how is it possible that we should both wish to join a club, and yet lose that wish as soon as it comes true? Why wouldn't we just be happy to have been allowed into this club? The answer lies in self-hatred; because for many of us, being accepted into a grand and beautiful club doesn't feel like what our inner psyches have been shaped to accept. We wonder how we can continue to believe in a club, or indeed a beloved now that they believe in us. There is usually a troubling Marxist moment in every relationship, a moment when it becomes clear that love is going to be reciprocated; that we won't simply admire someone from afar without hope of mutuality. The way the crisis is resolved depends on the balance between self-love and self-hatred in our own characters. If self-hatred gains the upper hand, then the one who is being loved back will declare that the beloved (on some excuse or other) is just not good enough for them (not good enough by virtue of associating with no-goods). But if self-love gains the upper hand, then both partners may accept that seeing their love reciprocated is not proof of how low the beloved is, but instead of how lovable they have themselves turned out to be. It emerges that knowing how to love ourselves a little can be one of the kindest and therefore most romantic things we can ever learn to do for our partners."

    "Transcript": "You're turning the pages and a very strange and very nice thing dawns on you. This book gets you. Obviously the author, who might have died centuries back, never knew you at all. But they write as if they did It's as if you'd confessed your secrets to them and then they'd gone of and written this work around what you told them. Transformed of course into a story about people with different names, or into a essay that doesn't cite your case explicitly. But might as well do, because it's so completely on target. We never quite feel we are understood well enough. Even by the people who we genuinely like and who are emotionally attached to us. A permafrost of loneliness often persists just below the surface. Even when things are broadly speaking going well enough. All this, the book that understands you, appears to know and to be able to correct. The book in question might be one that speaks to millions, like the Harry Potter series. Or it could be an almost unique discovery of your own. Perhaps Schiller's 'Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Mankind' Written at the very end of the eighteenth century With it's haunting efforts to fuse a noble idealism with political realism It could be a self-help book about sex but alights on just the things that are troubling you Or you might feel that 'Mademoiselle de Maupin' Written by Théophile Gautier in the middle of the 19th century And which tells the story of a man and a woman who are both in love with a central character. the operasinger Madeline de Maupin Was written by historical miracle exactly for you A book knows you by pinpointing And taking very seriously, a major but often ignored problem that happens to be looming in your existence. For instance, when Harry Potter is with the Dursleys the feeling of being an alien in a familiar environment For long stretches of time Harry has to live around people who have no idea of his real nature They never acknowledge his actual strengths He's regarded as a contemptible freak for things that elsewhere would make him popular and important. The book is hugely alive to the feeling of not being appreciated. With many books we're pleased because we encounter sympathy for things that deserve generous treatment but normally don't get it. The darker aspects of one's character are getting a tender hearing. You've been heard, you've heard others And the book says - I know So often despite all the people around us We're lonely and ashamed We're haunted by the worry that no reasonable person could feel anything but derision or contempt for our problems. We feel that to share them with our friends would lead to bewildered rejection. A book that understands you is like an ideal parent or friend, who makes it acceptable to suffer in the way we do. Our weirdest sorrows or enjoyments are recast as valid parts of human experience which can be met with sympathy and kindness. It is, even though the relationship is with paper and ink only, a kind of love. And perhaps one of the deepest kinds of love we'll ever know."

    "Title": "On Being Out of Touch With One's Feelings",
    "Transcript": "An enormous amount of trouble in the world, especially at work and in relationships, is caused by a peculiar phenomenon of our minds: a tendency to be, as we put it, \"out of touch with our feelings\". When we first meet this idea, it sounds strange and even a bit insulting. How could \"we\" not know what \"we\" are feeling? Of course, we look from the outside like unified beings; we carry one name, and sit in a compact, physical container. The distances between different parts of us aren't so great. How then could we be so multiple as to have secrets from ourselves? But in reality, there are at least two distinct parts to mental life: a Feeling Self, and an Observer Self. Sometimes the two are utterly aligned, someone asks us what we feel like eating, and the communication between the two selves is clear and immediate, we don't even notice a lag. we simply answer: \"Salmon and Avocado\" At other points, it's far trickier - we're sitting on the sofa at home after a long day at work and are under the impression that we feel quite calm, and suddenly, an apparently minor remark from our partner arouses us to deep irritation we stand up and start shouting about the unfairness of a host of issues we had until just then unaware we even felt strongly about. Soon, we've got a crisis in our hands. Why is it so hard for the Observing Self to report accurately on feelings? Firstly, because we're afflicted by so many background ideas about the unacceptability of particular feelings. Across childhood, we have instilled in us, so subtly we don't even notice, strong notions about what are, and are not, permissible things to experience. Traditionally, this might have meant that boys were not allowed to acknowledge that they felt like crying, or that girls weren't allowed to entertain certain kinds of ambitions for fear of being \"unladylike\". We might not have such obviously naive prohibitions today, but other equally powerful ones have taken their place. We may have picked up covert but forceful indications that no decent person, no one loved by their parents at least, could be enthusiastic about making money or unable to cope with work, tempted by an affair or still upset over a breakup three years ago. Furthermore, despite the apparently sexually liberated spirit of the times, the lion's share of our sexual impulses remains impossible to avow. There is still a great deal we're not meant to feel, in order to fit our most desirable of categories: a \"good boy\" or \"good girl\". When difficult feelings do threaten to emerge, the Observing Self typically takes fright and looks away. Rather than produce an honest account of feelings, he may go numb, or try to file a report that's more acceptable than true. \"I'm feeling very tired\", instead of \"I'm feeling you've let me down.\" \"I'm depressed\" rather than \"I'm furious\". \"That's absolutely disgusting!\" rather than \"I'm strangely turned on.\" Our problems are compounded by the way that many powerful feelings, especially of upset, envy and frustration, can get kicked into action by apparently very trivial and seemingly nonsensical things in the outside world. For example, we might be thrown into paracosms of envy we find no room to confess to when a friend mentions that a mutual acquantaince has been promoted, or a partner may look away for 3.5 seconds before we've entered an explanation about how tricky a work meeting went, and we experience seething indignation and wounded pride that we haven't got our lover's full attention. But we say nothing, because to own up to many feelings of upset, involves acknowledging a humiliating degree of fragility. Yet, feelings that haven't been reported don't and can't go away. They linger, and spread their energy randomly to neighbouring issues. Envy comes out as spite, anger over inattention comes out as a remark that the partner is looking \"rather fat at the moment.\" Though of course, by the time that hurt has manifested itself as aggression, any chances of being comforted are clearly over. Feelings we haven't got a handle on wreak havoc. They buckle and strain the system We develop pernicious ticks, a facial twitch, impotence, and incapacity to work. Alcoholism, a compulsion to look at porn, most so-called \"addictions\" are, at heart, symptoms of insistent, difficult feelings that we haven't found any better way to address. How then might we come to be more skilled observers in correspondence to our feelings? Reading may have rather a large role to play, a great writer is ideally, someone uncommonly patient about the curious, less discussed, and apparently weirder things that float around in the human head. Another move is to ensure that we've allocated a lot of time to self-observation. It can look rather self-indulgent to ask for a few hours in the evening, in which there is nothing more apparently demanding to do, than sit and stare out of the window or around the bedroom with a pad and pen on one's lap. These so-called \"idle moments\" are when the Observing Self can finally catch up with feelings that might have been too shy, ashamed or harassed to emerge in the rest of the day. They are like church bells we can make out only in the evening when city traffic has died down. Failing to do this can, among other things, ruin our chances of getting to sleep. Insomnia, is the Feeling Self's revenge. All thoughts that haven't been properly catalogued in the day. Understanding the serious danger of the gap opening up between \"what we feel\" and \"what we're aware of\" brings another major benefit: We grasp that this issue unnecessarily apply to other people too. Quite often, they will be saying things which are not, in fact, in line with their true feelings. Mean things when they're feeling vulnerable, perhaps, or arrogant things when they're feeling small, and will identify that it's our duty to forgive them for not always managing to be reliable correspondents of their inner lives. It's not really sinister to think this way of others it's a kindly move that gives us the energy to lend a second, more compassionate look at behaviour that might initially have appeared simply horribly off-putting. Feelings are frequently far from wonderful, and often, should not be followed. But we should accept that if we ignore, deny, or overlook feelings entirely, the price will always be higher and worse. They will exercise a powerful, malignant, subterranean influence across the whole of our lives. One of the two often overlooked, but key arts of living, is to learn to devote ourselves to correctly labelling and repatriating our own, and others', orphan feelings."

understanding and human connections have no power whatsoever to solve problems where who you are in other words a pretty decent honest and well-meaning individual doesn't matter in the least the deeper stress is that the details of your life count for nothing against the purely formal requirements of an administrative system the evolution of bureaucracy is a major development of the last 200 years in traditional societies power used to be personal and the relationships to people intimate the clan Chief knew and was related to all the governed there was therefore always a sense even if it might have been frustrated in practice that one might be able to sway the powerful to one's cause the downside was that opportunities for favoritism nepotism and bribery were endless there was constant special pleading and exceptions to the rules but at least when you were up against it you had a chance that a real human might listen to your cries bureaucracy has on the whole been an enormous achievement a logical Fair dispassionate machine for dealing with large numbers of people people without fear or favor this was the point beautifully articulated by the German sociologist Max

    "Title": "The Lottery of Life",
    "Transcript": "In the modern world, many countries have lotteries. And every week, many millions of people participate. In the hope of suddenly acquiring a substantial fortune. A striking thing is that it's often quite disadvantaged and uneducated people, Who are most enthusiastic about lotteries. We might smile at their folly in getting statistics quite so wrong. – if they had the wisdom and mathematical intelligence to understand How slim their chances really were, They'd surely never bother. The chances of winning the largest payout is 1 in 14 million (nearly the same probability as being one of the Queen's children, currently a 1 in 15 million chance). We naturally feel a bit sorry for people investing in such slender hopes. They are taking aim at an impossibly small target. But we're no better. We may not have a sense that we're playing any kind of lottery. – and yet we are: the Lottery of Life. We too are clutching tickets of various kinds and setting our sights on statistical near-miracles. – even while we think we're being utterly sober, rational and level headed. The crucial place where this lottery-like behaviour happens is in relation to our hopes of happiness in two areas in particular: love and work. If we were forced to spell out a picture of an ideally successful life, it might go something like this. Early on we pick just the right area of work to apply ourselves to, swerve neatly into new fields at the ideal moment and get public recognition, money and honour for our efforts. Work is fun, creative and utterly in line with our talents. There are similar satisfactions to be had around love. After a spate of compelling and passionate relationships, We meet one very special beautiful, kind and devoted person. Who understands us completely – often without us needing to communicate with words. Sex is extraordinary and children and domesticity never grind us down. We enjoy perfect health and retire with the feeling of having accomplished what we set out to do, and enjoy a dignified, respected old age, admired by our descendants and occasionally exercising a deft guiding touch behind the scenes as an eminence grise. We die gently in our late nineties of a non-painful illness in a tranquil, flower filled room, having written a wise and generous will. Such scenarios occur about as often as a payout at the Lottery. But (to our surprise, despite our education and apparently realistic and practical natures), We may have strongly invested in some modified version of just this form of ideal life. We don't quite grasp just how rare and strange ninety years on earth are without major disasters in love and work. Our brains – the faulty walnuts through which we assess reality – have a  habit of fatefully misunderstanding statistics. We imagine some things are much more common than they really are. We might suppose that half of new businesses are a great success. In fact, it is less than two per cent. We readily suppose that a lot of people have flat stomachs. – though in Australia, for instance, only 4% of adults over 45 have a slender physique. In the UK about half the population feels worried about money on any particular day; half of marriages collapse and sixty percent of the population feel that no one really loves them. But we rarely keep these kinds of facts in mind when we plot our own trajectories. Part of the reason lies with what we read and see. Without anything necessarily sinister lying behind this, The media continually bring anomalies to our notice, and so we end up feeling we're inhabiting a very different kind of world to the one we actually live in. Our imagined society is likely to contain many more murders, rabid dogs, man-eating sharks, and beautiful happy people than the real world does. Our mental map of how much contentment is possible defies all the known facts. If we could really see what love and work were like for most other people, we'd be so much less sad about our own situation and attainments. If we could fly across the world and peer into everyone's lives and minds like an all-seeing angel, we'd perceive how very frequent disappointment is, how much unfulfilled ambition is circulating, How much confusion and uncertainty is being played out in private and how many breakdowns and intemperate arguments unfold with every new day. And then we'd realise just how – statistically speaking – abnormal and therefore cruel the goals we have set ourselves really are. It would be a painful lesson in some ways. We might be shocked and saddened by what we saw. We'd be disappointed, of course, to conclude that in all probability, we wouldn't achieve what we'd hoped for. But in another way it would be a comforting and deeply reassuring experience. We'd feel a little more tenderness towards ourselves for not having – in effect – won the Lottery of Life. Without being overtly naive, most of us are holding out hopes equivalent to thinking we might win EuroMillions or the PowerBall jackpot. We don't deserve criticism. We need to pity ourselves for the formidable obstacles that sit in the way of the kind of success that it is so normal to want – and yet so rare to have."

    "Transcript": "Some deeply worrying things are, as always, happening in the world. However bad it is, we have an additional complication: what we call the news, is really a business that understands that you can't make money by telling people that things are, on balance, going to be okay. The point of the news is to make money by scaring us (and it does this brilliantly). But we need an antidote, and we can find it in a resource thats on hand to remind us that difficulties aren't new, that troubles can be survived, and that is has in fact been a lot worse than this before. It's an antidote we call 'history'. When political events seem to reach a new low, we might – for example – turn to the writings of the ancient Roman historian Suetonius. Born towards the end of the first century AD. Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus was an imperial administrator and chief secretary to the emperor Hadrian. He was the first historian to try to give an accurate portrait of what the rulers of the empire, from Julius Cesar down to Domitian, had actually been like. It's a shocking story. Suetonius's book amounts to a catalogue of extraordinary follies and crimes of the first twelve men to rule the western world. Amongst them: Julius Caesar: Who emerges as a thief, a liar, an egomaniac and a murderer. Caligula: A notorious psychopath who, to quote Suetonius, 'sent people down the mines or thrown to the wild beasts or confined in narrow cages where they they had to crouch or were sawn in half, not for major offences but because they did not properly admire a show he had sponsored at the Circus or did not refer with sufficient respect to his genius.' Suetonius tells us that: 'The method of execution he preferred was to inflict numerous small wounds but avoiding all major organs. He often gave the command: 'Make them feel they are dying'.' Then came Nero; of him we hear: 'He dressed himself in the skins of wild animals and attacked the private parts of men and women bound to stakes.' 'He wandered through the streets at night randomly murdering strangers and throwing their bodies into the sewers.' Afterwards, it was the turn of Vitellus: His ruling vices were gluttony and cruelty. He banqueted three or four times a day and he survived by taking frequent emetics. He used to give himself a treat by having prisoners executed before his eyes.' Then it was time for Domitian: 'At the beginning of his reign Domitian would spend hours alone every day catching flies and stabbing them with a needle-sharp pen.' He wasn't any nicer to his own people. Though Suetonius writes about grotesque individuals – who were also at the time the most powerful people on the planet – reading him can leave one feeling remarkably serene. One might read him tucked up in bed, after news of the latest election win. The experience is strangely reassuring, because it's at heart a narrative of resilience. Suetonius writes of earthquakes, plagues, wars, riots, rebellions, conspiracies, betrayals, coups, terrorism and mass slaughter. Considered on its own it might seem to be the record of a society whose collapse must surely be immanent. But in fact Suetonius was writing before – and not after – the most impressive period of Roman achievement – which would come fifty years later under the rule of the stoic philosopher and Emperor, Marcus Aurelius. The disasters that Suetonius catalogues were compatible with a society heading overall towards peace and prosperity. Reading Suetonius suggests that it is not fatal for societies to be in trouble; it is in fact usual for things to go rather badly. In this respect, reading ancient history generates the opposite emotions to scanning today's news. Events have been much worse before and things were, in the end, OK. People behaving very badly is a normal state of affairs. There have always been existential threats to the human race and civilisation. It makes no sense, and is a form of twisted narcissism, to imagine that our era has any kind of monopoly on idiocy. By reading Suetonius we enter unconsciously into his less agitated and more Stoic responses. He and History more generally encourage access to what we need now more than ever: the less panicky, more resilient sides of ourselves."

    "Title": "Success at School vs Success in Life",
    "Transcript": "We want to do well at school for an obvious reason: because – as we're often told – it's the primary route to doing well at life. Few of us are in love with the A grades themselves – we want them because we're understandably interested in one day having a fulfilling career, a pleasant house and the respect of others. But, sometimes, more often than seems entirely reassuring, something confusing occurs: we come across people who triumphed at school – but flunked at life. And vice versa. The former stars who once knew exactly how to satisfy their teachers may now be flatlining in a law office, or relocating to a provincial town in the hope of finding something better. The path that seemed guaranteed to lead to success has run into the sand. We shouldn't actually be surprised: school curricula are not designed by people who necessarily have much experience of, or talent at, the world beyond. School curricula are not reverse engineered from fulfilled adult lives in the here and now. They were intellectually influenced by all kinds of slightly random forces over hundreds of years of evolution – shaped by, among other things, the curricula of Medieval monasteries, the ideas of some 19th-century German educationalists and the concerns of aristocratic court societies. This helps to explain the many bad habits schools inculcate: - They suggest that the most important things are already known; that what is is all that could be. They can't help but warn us about the dangers of originality. - They want us to put up our hands and wait to be asked. They want us to keep asking other people for permission. - They teach us to deliver on, rather than change, expectations. - They teach us to redeploy ideas rather than originate them. - They teach us to expect that people in authority  – rather than letting us imagine that – in rather inspiring ways – no one actually knows quite what's going on. – They teach us to trust that They teach us everything other than the two skills that really determine the quality of adult life; knowing how to choose the right job for us and knowing how to form satisfactory relationships. They'll instruct us in Latin and how to measure the circumference of a circle long before they teach us those core subjects: Work and Love. ** That said, it isn't that all we need to do to succeed at life is flunk school. A good life requires us to do two very tricky things: be an extremely good boy or girl for 20 years; and simultaneously never really believe blindly in the long-term validity or seriousness of what we're being asked to study. We need to be outwardly entirely obedient while inwardly intelligently and unashamedly rebellious."

    "Title": "How to Remain Calm With People",
    "Transcript": "One of the most important ways to calm down is the power to hold on. Even in challenging situations to a distinction between what someone does and what they meant to do. In law, the difference is enshrined in the contrasting concepts of murder and manslaughter. The result may be the same: the body is inert in a pool of blood. But we collectively feel it makes a huge difference what the perpetrators intentions were. Motives are crucial, but unfortunately we're seldom very good at perceiving what motives happened to be involved in the incidents that frustrate us. We're easily and wildly mistaken. We see intention where there was none and escalate and confront when no strenuous or agitated responses are in fact warranted. Part of the reason why we jump so readily to dark inclusions and see plots to insult and harm us is a rather poignant psychological phenomenon: Self-hatred. The less we like ourselves, the more we appear in our own eyes as really rather plausible targets for mockery and harm. Why would a drill have started up outside just as we were settling down to work? Why are the email not arrive even though we'll have to be in a meeting very soon? Why would the phone operator be taking so long to find our details? Because there is, logically enough, a plot against us. Because we are appropriate targets for these kinds of things. Because we're the sort of people against whom disruptive drilling is legitimately likely to be directed. It's what we deserve. When we carry a background excess of self-disgust around with us operating just below the radar of conscious awareness. We'll constantly seek confirmation from the wider world that we really are the worthless people we take ourselves to be. The expectation is almost always set in childhood where someone close to us is likely to have left us feeling dirty and culpable. And as a result we now travel through society assuming the worst. Not because it's necessarily true or pleasant to do so, but because it feels familiar. And because as the prisoners of past patterns we haven't yet understood. We would be so much calmer around adults, if we could resort to some of the unflustered poised we naturally use around children. Small children sometimes behave in really maddening ways. They scream at the person who's looking after them, angry push away a bowl of animal pastor, throw away something you've just fetched for them. But we rarely feel personally agitated or wounded by their behavior. And the reason is that we don't assign a negative motive or mean intention to a small person. We reach around for the most benevolent interpretations. We probably think that they're just a bit tired, or their gums are sore, or they're upset by the arrival of a younger sibling. We've got a large repertoire of alternative explanations ready in our heads. And none of these lead us to panic or get terribly agitated. This is the reverse of what tends to happen around adults. Here we imagine that people have deliberately got us in their sights. If someone edges in front of us in the airport queue it's natural to suppose that they've sized this up and of reason that they can safely take advantage of us. They probably relish the thought of causing us a little distress. But if we employ the infant model of interpretation our first assumptions would be very different. We think that maybe they didn't sleep well that night, have a sore knee, or have been upset by their lover. The French philosopher Inmilo Gustachtie, known as Ella, was set to be the finest teacher in France in the first half of the 20th century. And he developed a formula for calming himself and his pupils down in the face of irritating people. Never say that people are evil. He wrote. You just need to look for the pin. What he meant was: look for the source of the agony that drives a person to behave in appalling ways. The calming thought is to imagine that they're suffering off stage in some area we can't see. To be mature is to learn to imagine this zone of pain in spite of the lack of much available evidence. They may not look as if they were mad and by an inner psychological element. They may seem chirpy and full of themselves, but the pin simply must be there or they would not be causing us harm. When others maden us we need to imagine the turmoil, disappointment, worry, and sadness beneath an aggressive surface. We need to aim compassion in an unexpected place at those who annoy us most. We must do that very strange thing: move from anger to pity."

    "Title": "In Praise of Short-Term Love",
    "Transcript": "One of the big assumptions of our times is that if love is real, it must by definition prove to be eternal. We invariably and naturally equate genuine relationships with life-long relationships. And therefore it seems almost impossible for us to interpret the ending of a union after only a limited period... a few weeks, or five or ten years, or anything short of our or the partner's death-date... as something other than a problem, a failure and an emotional catastrophe that is someone's fault, probably our own. There are people desperate that they've failed because their relationships have lasted only thirty-two years. We appear fundamentally unable to trust that a relationship could be at once sincere, meaningful and important... and yet at the same time fairly and guiltlessly limited in its duration. There are, of course, a few very good reasons for our collective valorisation of the life-long love story. A great many of the pleasures and virtues of relationships do only reveal themselves over time, once trust has been established and loyalty fully demonstrated. When two people know it's forever, they will work harder than at anything else in their lives, there's no option to avoid some necessary but unpleasant issues, they will do their utmost to understand the mysteries of the other's psyche, they will show reserves of tenderness and vulnerability they wouldn't ever otherwise have accessed. They will learn to apologize and reach a modesty about their own shortcomings. They will grow up. And in the meantime, day-to-day, they will sample the modest but genuine pleasures of cosy Sunday evenings together and shared walks in country parks. Not least, children always benefit. But it's because the charms of the long-term are so clear in our collective imaginations that we should acknowledge the danger of cruelly and normatively suppressing all the legitimate claims of short-term love, an arrangement which deserves to be interpreted not merely as a pathologically stunted or interrupted version of a long-term union, but as a state with distinctive virtues of its own, one that we might rationally choose from the outset, knowing from the start that it would be better for both parties if there was a termination point more or less in view. So much can go right with short-term love: When two people know they don't own one another, they are extremely careful to earn each other's respect on a daily basis. Knowing someone could leave us at any time isn't only grounds for insecurity, it's a constant catalyst for tender appreciation. When it isn't forever, we can let differences lie. If the journey is to be long, absolute alignment can feel key. But when the time is short, we're readier to surrender our entrenched positions, to be unthreatened by novelties and dissonances. The distinctive things they have in their fridge and the peculiar things they like to watch and listen to aren't affronts to our values, they're unthreatening invitations to expand our personalities. Very few of us come out well from being closely observed, 24 hours a day, in a limited space. These may simply not be the preconditions for getting the best out of some of us. Our interesting and generous sides may need, in order to emerge, our own bedroom and bathroom, quite a few hours to ourselves, some space to read and think and a series of mealtimes alone staring rather blankly out of the window without having to explain how we feel. It's not a sign of evil, just what we require to be the best version of ourselves. What makes people difficult and dooms relationships is almost never the people involved. It's what we're trying to do with them. Inviting someone to marry you is really not a very kind thing to do to someone you love, because it's going to drag the beloved into a range of really rather unpleasant and challenging things: doing the accounts with you, meeting your family regularly, seeing you exhausted and bleary-eyed after work, keeping the living room tidy, bringing up a child. To really love someone – that is, to wish the best for someone – might more fairly mean foregrounding your best qualities for a few ecstatic months, and then mutually and tenderly parting at the check-in desk. Long-term relationships reward some qualities – especially the administrative ones – but they obscure others, for example, those related to skills at having interesting speculative conversations about ethics or the meaning of life late into the night. It should be no insult to determine that some people simply won't be able to shine in the conditions of long-term love, and that it's very kindly playing up to their strengths to leave them long before we ever need to try to arrange a cutlery drawer with them. We should beware of succumbing to the debilitating feeling that because it didn't last forever, it can have been nothing at all. In other areas of life, we know that 'going on forever' isn't the ideal (even when something is very good). We don't necessarily think we have to stay in the same house all our lives though we might really like the one we're in; we're not betraying it or destroying it when we recognize that for a range of reasons it might be wisest to move elsewhere. We need to have an account of love which allows that a relationship can end without anyone having viciously or pathologically killed it prematurely, for only against such a backdrop can we reduce the debilitating quantity of bitterness, guilt and blame that's otherwise in circulation. How we see the endings of love depends to a critical extent on what our societies tell us is 'normal'. If it was meant to last forever, then every ending will by necessity have to be described as a horrifying failure. But if we allow imaginative space for short-term love, then an ending may signal a deeper loyalty, not to setting up of a home and domestic routines, but to a deep appreciation and admiration one felt for someone for a time; we'll walk away with a fair and generous sense of all that's been preserved and enhanced by the relationship not being forced to last forever."

    "Title": "How to End a Relationship",
    "Transcript": "It's a skill that's just as important, but far less studied, than knowing how to start things off. We're typically appalling at it. We mumble, we delay, we become strange, we hedge… And there's one reason we make such a mess of it. It's not that we're inept or dumb or cruel. It's that we're trying to be kind. That's the origin of all our ineptness, stupidity and cruelty. We hesitate to be cold and try to be nice because we are sentimental. The essence of sentimentality is the desire to be liked, even by those you don't like and can no longer be bothered with. It's a narcissistic longing to continue to receive the emotion of love without wanting to pay for it. But kindness has no role whatsoever to play at the charred end of relationships. Being sweet and understanding merely prolongs the torture for the other person. If we're being so tender, is it really possible that we truly mean the dark things we are ostensibly saying? Could we be so loving and at the same time, calling it a day? We need above all else to kill hope. But instead, too often, we just waffle. Marcel Proust wisely observed: 'At the end of relationships, it's the one who is not in love who makes the tender speeches.' Parting lovers may end up in the grotesque situation of one person crying because they are being left, and the other crying because of the distress that announcing the departure has caused them... tears that are mistaken by the abandoned party for signs of care. The kindest way to end a relationship is just to make extremely brutal speeches... of a sort that will leave the other person in no doubt at all that you're not an especially nice person. The truly courageous way to leave is to allow yourself to be hated by someone who loves you. That's generosity. There's no excuse for delay. Don't imagine that you're doing someone a favour by dragging out how long they can persist in the benign illusion that you want them. Their real priority is to stop wasting their lives. Don't imagine that they won't ever find anyone else like you: they may believe that now and might even sweetly tell you so. But they won't believe it when they finally understand who you actually are. Real kindness means getting out – even though the holiday has been booked and it will be terribly awkward to tell everyone at this late stage. There's nothing at all wrong with deciding that someone isn't for you. There is something very wrong with ruining large chunks of someone else's life while you squeamishly and sentimentally hesitate to get out of the way."

    "Title": "Being Jollied Along",
    "Transcript": "There are friends who are very well meaning but who nevertheless have a habit of responding in unfortunate ways when we reveal a trouble to them. They try with considerable vigour to cheer us up. We may appreciate their underlying good nature, while nevertheless profoundly resenting their particular technique. For what we may want from them above all is not a swift enjoinder that our problems are in fact, despite appearances, easily solvable but rather a shared moment of sadness and mournful sympathy. There are times when we can't believe in quick answers but we want company nevertheless. We want to give way to a low-level muted sadness and a joint acceptance that life is inherently difficult. Sadness isn't always a disorder that needs to be cured. And yet, the dominant tone of many friendships continues to be cheerful or, its more brittle cousin, cheery. A good mood that tolerates no other. This falsely presumes that the best way to please others must always be to impose a vibrant frame of mind when, in fact, admission of despair is a key tool in the process of friendship properly reimagined. In a discussion of parenting styles the psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott once identified a particularly problematic kind of child carer - the person who wants to \"jolly\" babies and small children along, always picking them up with exaggerated cheer, bouncing them up and down, and pulling wide funny faces, perhaps shouting \"Peekaboo!\" repeatedly. This criticism might feel disconcerting. What could be so wrong with wanting to keep a child jolly?! Yet Winnicott was worried by what effect this would have on a child. The weight was subtly not giving the child any chance to acknowledge its own sadness- or more broadly, its own feelings. The jollier doesn't give the child an opportunity to set the tone. He or she just wants to impose a mood which may have no basis in the child's reality. The jollier doesn't only want the child to be happy- more alarmingly, it can't tolerate the idea that it might be sad. So unexplored and potentially overwhelming are their own feelings of unresolved disappointment and grief. Childhood is necessarily full of sadness... As adulthood must be too, insisted Winnicott. Which means we must perpetually be granted the possibility of periods of mourning - for a broken toy, the grey sky on a Sunday afternoon, or perhaps the lingering sadness we can see in our parents' eyes. The friend, no less than the carer needs to remember how much of life deserves to have solemn and mournful moments- And of how much loyalty we will always be ready to offer those who don't feel aggressively compelled to deny our melancholy."

    "Transcript": "Let's imagine two kinds of childhood The first, broadly, is the good kind when you are upset someone is on hand to sooth you. When you're furious, someone handles you calmly. When you need attention, someone is there for you. When you can't understand, someone explains. When you're messy someone resists shaming you. When you fail, you're not called a loser. When there's a problem, you get through it. In short, you deserve to exist. Whatever the value system of the competitive world out there inside you're of huge value, you are for as long as it takes the center of one or two kindly grown ups universe. Then broadly there's the challenging old plain bad childhood. When you cry, they call you spoiled. When you're difficult, they say it's attention seeking. When you don't succeed, they take it personally. When you're messy, they're disgusted. When you try to be strong, they're threatening. When you 're weak and unimpressive, they belittle you. In short, it's a bit of a pity you're around. You don't quite deserve to exist. You're a burden and in the end really just a giant disappointment. The first kind of childhood is just about the greatest gift anyone can receive. It's at the root of the chance to form satisfying relationships, to accept one's sexuality, to have ambition without perfectionism and to approach adversity with resilience. And likewise a bad sort of childhood is proper lasting trouble. It keeps undermining relationships, generates endless problems around sex saps confidence, brings anxieties, self hatred and shame. We don't yet know how completely to fix bad childhoods. They're a proper pain to have had, but here are one or two things to try very hard to keep in mind. Do everything you can to understand the craziness inside you. Be suspicious of many of your first intuitions and responses. Watch out for weird stuff you're gonna try to do to sabotage your chances of flourishing. Warn people around you in a gentle and alarming way about what you've being through. Invite them to feel sorry for you rather than just condemn you for being difficult. Try to get all the insights you can, from books, therapy and thinking. Accept that this is a legacy you're a gonna be carrying around with you all your life. Feel without self pity a little bit sorry for yourself."

A number of tips suggest themselves Firstly: don't attempt to minimize what's happened Being brave has no place here. Allow your sadness so much room, so much time, so many melancholic songs, hot baths and indulgent meals You'll eventually bore yourself back into an appetite for life. Secondly: believe them when they said it. Don't imagine that their past sweetness and kind words provides any covert indications of future commitment. Kill any remaining hope yourself, if they didn't quite have the courage to do so themselves. Don't imagine that anyone can love on command The capacity to feel attracted lies outside the will It isn't a question of them not trying hard enough Remove morality from it They were not being bad for not loving and nor were you good for wanting them You were both on the search for pleasure that took you down different and conflicting routes Our conscious minds ride like tiny boats on the swells of unconscious psychoanalytic and biological seas. So don't turn this into a morality tale They acted weirdly around the break-up not because they were bad or indeed unsure, they just felt terribly guilty because they're nice which doesn't, though, mean that they want you Many of us are predisposed to think especially well of people who don't want us It feeds into our reserves of self-hatred But this isn't romanticism. It's an illness The true challenge is to stop being so revolted by people who do in fact want us and so admiring of those who don't Think back to when you rejected people You didn't hate them or regret them The chief emotions are embarrassment and pity Don't connect up the rejection with everything you fear and hate about being you Don't accuse them of cowardice Don't exaggerate their qualities Don't insist on their uniqueness Don't offer them sex in the hope of changing their mind Don't imagine that people can fall back in love with someone out of pity or of guilt and don't defensively maintain that they had a fear of intimacy Just try to laugh and have a few rounds of casual sex if that helps But above all, don't keep thinking of the end of this relationship as tragically sad The only good relationship, the only relationship worth mourning would be one to which two people desperately wanted to belong And this wasn't, in the end, despite all the promising signs, that kind of relationship at all."

    "Title": "LITERATURE - Fyodor Dostoyevsky",
    "Transcript": "A good trick, with his name, is to say 'toy' in the middle: Dos-toy-ev-ski. He was born 1821 and grew up on the outskirts of Moscow. His family were comfortably off – his father was a successful doctor, though he happened to work at a charitable hospital that provided medical services for the very poor. The family had a house in the hospital complex, so the young Dostoevsky was from the very beginning powerfully exposed to experiences from which other children of his background were usually carefully sheltered. Like almost everyone in Tsarist Russia his parents were devout Orthodox Christians and Dostoevsky's own religious faith got deeper and stronger throughout his life. At the age of 12 he was sent away to school first in Moscow and later in the capital, St Petersburg. He got a good education, though as a child of the tiny professional middle-class he felt out of place among his more aristocratic classmates. While he was away at school his father died possibly murdered by his own serfs. After graduating Dostoevsky worked as an engineer for a while. He started gambling and losing money, something that was to plague him all his life. In his late twenties, he became friends with a group of radical writers and intellectuals. He wasn't deeply involved but when the government decided to crack down on dissent, Dostoevsky was rounded up too and sentenced to be shot by a firing squad. However, at the last moment – just when the soldiers were ready to fire a message of a reprieve arrived. Dostoyevsky was sent instead to Siberia for four years of forced labour in horrific conditions. It was only after his return from Siberia that Dostoevsky established himself as a writer. Starting in middle age he produced a series of major books. They are dark, violent and tragic – and usually very long and complicated. He wrote them to preach five important lessons to the world. Incidentally, the discussion of Dostoevsky's ideas does involve revealing the plots of some of his novels. It's not something that would have worried him because his books are written to be read more than once. But if it bothers you, this is the place to break off. Dostoyevsky's first big book – Notes from the Underground – is an extended rant against life and the world delivered by a retired civil servant. This civil servant is deeply unreasonable, inconsistent and furious with everyone, including himself. He's always getting into rows, he goes to a reunion of some former colleagues, and tells them all how much he has always hated them. He wants to puncture everyone's illusions and make them as unhappy as he is. He seems like a grotesque character to build a book around. But he's doing something important. He's insisting with a peculiar kind of intensity – on a very strange fact about the human condition. We want happiness but we have a special talent for making ourselves miserable. He asserts. In the novel, Dostoevsky is taking aim at philosophies of progress and improvement – which were highly popular in his age, as they continue to be in ours. He is attacking our habit of telling ourselves that if only this or that thing were different, we could leave suffering behind. If we got that great job, changed the government, could afford that great house, invented a machine to fly us faster around the world, could get together with, or divorced from a particular person, then all would go well. This, Dostyevsky argues, is a delusion. Suffering will always pursue us. Schemes for improving the world always contain a flaw. They won't eliminate suffering, they will only change the things that cause us pain. Life can only ever be a process of changing the focus of pain, never of removing pain itself. There will always be something to agonise us. Stop people starving, says Dostoyevsky with calculated wickedness – and you'll soon find there's a new range of agonies: people will start to suffer from boredom, greed or intense melancholy that they haven't been invited to the right party. In this spirit, Notes from the Underground launches an attack on all ideologies of technical or social progress which aspire to the elimination of suffering. They won't succeed because as soon as they solve one problem, they'll direct our nature to become unhappy in new ways. Dostoyevsky is fascinated by the secret way, in which we actually don't want what we theoretically seem to seek. He discusses the pleasure a lot of people get from feelings of superiority, and for whom, consequently, an egalitarian society would be a nightmare. Or the disavowed but real thrill we get from hearing about violent crimes on the news, in which case we'd actually feel thwarted in a truly peaceful world. \"Notes from the Underground\" is a dark, awkwardly insightful, counterpoint to well-intentioned modern liberalism. It doesn't really show that social improvement is meaningless. But it does remind us that we'll always carry our very complex and difficult selves with us and that progress will never be as clear and clean as we might like to imagine. In Crime and Punishment, we meet an impoverished intellectual, Rodion Raskolnikov. Though he's currently a nobody, he's fascinated by power and ruthlessness. He thinks of himself as a version of Napoleon. \"Leaders of men, such as Napoleon, were all without exception criminals,\" we hear, \"they broke the ancient laws of their people to make new ones that suited them better, and they never feared bloodshed.” Raskolnikov is also desperate for money and so, aristocratic superiority in mind, he decides to murder an old woman who is a small time pawnbroker and money lender and to steal her cash. He's tormented by the mad injustice of the fact that this horrible, mean old character has drawers full of roubles while he – who is clever, energetic and profound – is starving. He doesn't spend much time thinking about options like taking a job as a waiter. So Raskolnikov breaks into her apartment and bludgeons her to death; and, surprised in the act by the woman's pregnant half-sister, kills her too. But it turns out he's nothing like the cold-blooded, rational hero of his own imagination. He is tormented by guilt and horror at what he has done. Eventually, he turns himself over to the police in order to face the proper punishment for his crime. We're probably never going to do what Raskolnikov did. But we often share a troubling tendency with him. We think we know ourselves better than we actually do. Raskolnikov thinks he's ruthless; actually, he's rather tender-hearted. He thinks he won't feel guilt; but he's overwhelmed by remorse. Part of our life's journey is to engage in the tricky task of disentangling ourselves from what we think we're like, in order to discover our true nature. Raskolnikov is especially fascinating because of the direction this self-discovery takes. His striking realisation is that he's actually a much nicer person than he takes himself to be. Whereas so many novelists delight in showing the sickly reality beneath a glamorous or enticing facade, Dostoevsky has embarked on a more curious but rewarding mission. He wants to reveal that beneath the so-called monster, there can very often be a far more interesting tender-hearted character lurking: a nice but deluded, intelligent but frightened and panicked person. Sticking for the moment with Crime and Punishment, it's very significant the way Dostoevsky gets us to like his murderous hero. Raskolnikov is clearly an attractive person. At the very start of the book, we're told: Dostoevsky throughout lessens the imaginative distance between 'us' who live mainly law-abiding and more or less manageable lives, and 'them' – the ones who do terrible things and wreak havoc with their lives and those of others. That person, he is saying, is more like you than you might initially want to think, and therefore more accessible to sympathy. The idea that you can be a good person, do something very bad and still deserve some compassion sounds maybe slight and obvious, until one has need of this kind of forgiveness in one's own life. This is where Dostoevsky wants to enter our inner conversation with ourselves, and tell us all about his character Raskolnikov, a serious, thoughtful, good-looking man who did worse than we have and still can be compassionately understood, as we can and must all be. This is Dostoevsky's Christianity at work: no one is outside the circle of God's love and understanding. Dostoyevsky's next great book, The Idiot, takes off from his near-death experience before the firing squad. In the novel, he recounts what that was like. Three minutes before his expected death he is able to see life clearly for the first time. He notices the gilded spire of a nearby church, and how it glitters in the sun. He'd never before realised how entrancing a glint of sunlight could be. He is filled with an immense, deep love of the world. You might see a beggar and think how you would love to change places with them so as to be able to continue to breathe the air and feel the wind, merely to exist, seems, at that moment of final revelation, infinitely precious. And then the revised order comes and it's not over at all. What would it be like to go through one's whole life in such a state of gratitude and generosity? You wouldn't share any of the normal attitudes. You'd love everyone equally, you'd be enchanted by the simplest things, you'd never feel angry or frightened. You would seem to other people to be a kind of idiot. Hence the title of Dostoyevsky's book. It's an extreme version of a very interesting step. We're continually surrounded by things which could delight us, if only we saw them in the right way, if only we could learn to appreciate them. Dostoevsky was desperate to communicate the value of existence before death would overtake him – and us. In Dostoyevsky's final great work – Brothers Karamazov, which came out when he was nearly 60, one of the central characters tells a long story-within-a-story. It's called The Grand Inquisitor, and imagines that the greatest event looked forward to by Christian theology, the second coming of Christ, has in fact already happened. Jesus did come back, several hundred years ago. He turned up in Spain, during the highest period of power in the Catholic Church: the organisation established, in theory at least, entirely in devotion to him. Christ is back to fulfil his teachings of forgiveness and universal love. But something rather odd happens. The most powerful religious leader, the Grand Inquisitor, has Jesus arrested and imprisoned. In the middle of the night, the Grand Inquisitor visits Christ in his cell and explains that he cannot allow him to do his work on Earth, because he is a threat to the stability of society. Christ, he says, is just too ambitious – too pure, too perfect. Humanity can't live up to the impossible goals he sets before us. The fact is, people haven't been able to live according to his teachings and Jesus should admit he failed and that his ideas of redemption were essentially misguided. The Grand Inquisitor is not really a monster. In fact, Dostoevsky portrays him as quite an admirable figure in the story. He is a guide to a crucial idea, that human beings cannot live in purity, cannot ever be just truly good, cannot live up to Christ's message, and this is something we should reconcile ourselves to with grace rather than fury or self-hatred. We have to accept a great deal of unreasonableness, folly, greed, selfishness and shortsightedness as ineradicable parts of the human condition and plan accordingly. And it's not just a pessimistic thesis about politics or religion that we're being introduced to. The primary relevance of this thesis is as a commentary on our own lives: we won't sort them out, we won't stop being a bit mad and wayward. And we shouldn't torment ourselves with the dream that we could, if only we tried hard enough, become the perfect beings that idealistic philosophies like Christianity like to sketch all too readily. Dostoevsky died in 1881. He had a very hard life, but he succeeded in conveying an idea which perhaps he understood more clearly than anyone: in a world that's very keen on upbeat stories, we will always run up against our limitations as deeply flawed and profoundly muddled creatures. Dostoyevsky's attitude, bleak but compassionate, tragic but kind, is needed more than ever in our naive and sentimental age that so fervently clings to the idea which this great Russian novelist loathed that science can save us all and that we may yet be made perfect through technology. Dostoyevsky guides us to a more humane darker truth: that – as the great sages have always known – life is and ever will be suffering, and yet that there is great redemption available in articulating this message in brilliant and moving, complex and subtle works of art."

    "Transcript": "um thank you so much thank you all for coming and most of all thank you to Peter tonight is really a chance to have a conversation not really an interview but a conversation and I think it seem fitting for me to begin with the music um and really to ask I want to start a really very basic question what is it about the human animal that makes us make music well I think we like to thump our chest show off a little bit dance um try and find a mate um I think there are lots of reasons for making music but let let's think about finding a mate in music tell tell us more well when you're a shy and spotty boy if you're in a rock band the world opens up in mysterious ways um but I think it it's a deep thing that um looking at some of um the creatures that we share the planet with they seem to also use sound uh communication and not always with a specific intent and I I I was sent uh to a public school and it was um it was just on the cusp of softening but it was still pretty unpleasant and really music was a retreat you know I used to go down in to the record Corner in godling and I'd pick up these blues and soul records and go down to the one room where we were allowed to play music and turn it up uh as loud as I could could and dance um what is it that you think that enables music to carry so much meaning um but at the same time meaning that we find it hard to Define it just exists in its own medium I guess it plugs directly into the nervous system in a way that a lot of other Communications go through more levels of filtering um um music you can feel it you know it hits your your chest um depending where the frequencies are there are patterns there that instinctively go in and and it's I so I think it's a a sort of quicker um release but maybe not as precise a weapon as a word you you you said so maybe more emotional I think you said in the context of uh a song that is particularly close to my heart heart I grieve um you said that that you said that you'd felt that you'd added a song uh to your emotional toolbox with that yeah well I think it is like a box of pills that you you have your certain records certain songs for delivering certain um emotional functions and uh and they may be to calm you down to comfort you to to excite you you know whatever whatever it is and I think um well actually I hadn't lost either of my parents my wife had lost her mom when I think I grieve came and and I was thinking there aren't really good I mean there are lots of songs people use at funerals when they lose people but um I didn't really know of one but was specifically about grief in that way and so I thought I I'll give it a go um and and is that generally how song Start I mean that you would literally think there's an area of the emotional map that hasn't been covered and that interests you and that and that you try and mine that so yeah that's sort of how it went and in in the emotional toolbox that you've built up as a musician what what are the areas that you feel you've been interested in and been drawn to I think yeah what I was talking about earlier about just making a lot of noise getting excited getting sexy getting a then calm meditative um and Transcendent you know and in another way and I think I was always drawn to to church music in a way uh hymns were a big influence on me you know bits of classical uh but but it was the sole people like Otis reading and nenina Simone where the sort of the grand um figures of of my and what was it that Drew you to them just what they could do with with the voice and the storytelling I mean there certain songs I remember exactly where I was in school when I first heard that song I remember with um Hey Joe you know which room I was in and and I was in the back of my parents car when I first heard the Beatles um in littlest on SE and uh that although you know it doesn't sound at all revolutionary now at the time Love Me Do sounded more revolutionary than punk music in its time um which people forget cuz you sort of absorb all that stuff but but just can I throw it back now cuz I think you're going to start um you know a good place to start his parents and I always think you know cuz we've just met at the school gate and this this is actually why we we're here so I don't you know I know a little bit of Al laugh from his books and so on but would you mind just describing what sort of people your parents were and which elements of them you you have inherited um yes or not inherited yes um my parents were first and foremost very anxious people um okay they were very they were they were people who who were incredibly ambitious about everything about life they were very excited by life very Dynamic people at the same time very fragile people and um I think a lot of my career has been an attempt to rescue them um one of them is no longer alive um and the other one is not really interested in my rescue efforts as such but I think sometimes as children a lot of one's career sometimes is spent in a dialogue with one's parents and I think that um I think that all this thing about wisdom and knowledge Etc I think I I'm trying to provide them with the stuff that I felt they might have needed um in the more distressed moments of their lives and how would you describe them individually individually um my uh father was I'm I just feel guilty about the audience um very poor cuz they're here for you but very quickly I think they're here for okay let's ask the audience no can I ask this question okay okay um so my my father was was a refugee from Egypt he uh came to Switzerland where I was born with nothing and was really a traumatized person met my mother who was uh Swiss they got married and I think what they wanted above all was security and stability uh but my father was he went into business but really his heart was in literature he wanted more than anything to write and to think uh what he did every weekend was to to read and to think about philosophy and Theory Etc and though he never talked to me about it at all I think again children will watch their parents it's not so much what they say it's what they do and I think that a lot of my life has been an attempt to uh do what maybe he never got a chance to do um and do it with him even though he's dead and for him uh so there's a lot of transgenerational effort and your mom a little more U my mother she was uh she is um a very energetic capable practical uh woman from whom she nothing is ever too much of a challenge for her and I think I learned the idea that um one just goes for things um and they were you know my mother especially she was not afraid of life and um I learned a lot from that courage really basic courage if if things went wrong she would pick herself up and go and I learned a lot from that but but um tell me about well my parents no no I that's a fair exchange okay good good we had but steering it back to music for a moment for a moment um Peter your music has meant so much to me I started listening to your music um when I was maybe 1213 um and I went backwards uh back to the early Genesis forwards and followed you really all the way and I can remember where I was when I first listened to to various things um we're going to play a clip from Red Rain not yet in a second but I remember being uh at school uh in the winter and it must have been a red rain was out in h don't know you know better than me anyway um it was it I can I can remember the room and listening to it in some of the feelings I was very interested in a quote you said you once said that music can be like an axe in a frozen sea which is a quote from nature which is a wonderful very dramatic quote an axe to a frozen sea which really suggests the idea of our emotions well what does it suggest to you that we lock away a lot of ourselves and there are certain instruments when they're finally tuned that can break them open let's come back to that but first let's just hear a little clip from Red Rain your skin I come to you defenses down with the trust of a [Music] child rain rain coming down rain Rain r rain is pouring down pouring down all over [Music] me and I can wa anymore no more Den I you it's so hard to lay down in all of this R rain coming down rain rain is pouring down rain rain is coming down all over me I see it R rain coming down R rain is pouring down red rain is coming down all over me I'm bathing in um wonderful song um we're a we're a therapeutic uh organization we can talk about Psychotherapy in a minute but some of the lyrics there defenses down um the trust of a child no more denial I mean this is this is from the toolbox of of therapy um tell us more well I guess after my first marriage broke up I did about six years of therapy and so some of that uh got absorbed and and I think I was probably a sucker for all that anyway um just um yeah that I've probably leared as as much from that sort of ENC to um and I was encouraged or pushed into sort of group therapy which I was the last thing I wanted to do was expose myself in a group but actually it was enormously powerful the word defense comes up both in in your music and and and some of the things you've said I think fear is undervalued probably it's a big element and um you know bravery is quite often a flip side of fear or just fear well channeled but um so I think or maybe that's part of my journey is learning to be less afraid and I think there are very few things that old age has going for it but maybe that's one of them and what had been the fears what are the fears that were overcome um I I had many fears I think but inadequacy of All Sorts I think prob probably but but it's you know I was never very good academically um with sport uh and then not going to a university you know I was not sure of myself in conversation with people who seem to be smarter than me and gradually as I've got older you know I've become much less afraid of other people and the more I challenge myself to do the things that I'd actually like to because I do think again sort of flicking it back again because you know you're a philosopher I'm a musician but in truth we've got away with pretty much doing anything we want to do and calling it work right good yeah you know and that's partly a function of of um getting a little more comfortable with your your fear I know as a writer people say you know where do the ideas come from and in a way it's a tedious question and in a way it's a very central question but I think it reflects just how mysterious most find it where does the song come from you really want to be wide open wide awake and able to steal absorb borrow uh and feed off anything that interests you you know I think again I've said this before but it should be like dogs in a park you sniff something interesting and you jump on it and some of your songs have taken decades to be assembled yeah and presumably there you're you're picking up many things from many dogs along the way it's a big part exactly um well also you know I'm a maybe afraid of the final commitment and I love detours and distractions and you know and I'll always go off on a tangent rather than finish my homework one of the things about your music is that it's always brought a lot of Solace it somehow seems very attuned to the vulnerability of The Listener and contributes a kind of a hand held out to them an imaginary hand and there's no song of yours that does this more powerfully than don't give up which I think has literally saved people from jumping off roofs I think so it seems that it's really surprised me you know CU it it it felt um it was actually begun after seeing the dth Lang or Lang I'm not sure pictures of the American depression and uh but it's ended up you know I think because you know particularly of the sort of emotive way that Kate sings and um and seems to be offering hope when there is very little um a lot of people have yeah used it and I mean it's extraordinary let's hear a short clip from don't give up you can fall back on us don't give up please don't give up got the one kind of feel I can take anymore going to stand on that bridge keep my eyes down below whatever make come and whatever may go that Rivers FL that Rivers flowing these are sort of archetypes in a way right this is this is Mom the mother yeah I guess in a way and yeah I hadn't thought of it as Mom but I thought of it more a sort of partner who was that's saying a lot about me isn't it well sorry go but maybe you know maybe we all marry our mom and well no I'll get into trouble if I say that anyway but but it's sort of nourishing yeah Comfort I guess what Frey calls the Eternal feminine seems right you know um that'll do that'll do we'll go to him on on that um and I've been watching lots of clips of you with in front of giant audiences in a way it's hard to reconcile with the person here even though we've got a fairly large audience but um we're talking tens of thousands that you might be performing in front of What's um who do you become when you're doing that how does how do you access that that part of you different part of VI I I think you just got to buy it and believe it and um I learned very early on that if you're sort of shy and apologetic people will switch off very quickly so you have to sort of pump yourself up and and then give them something they may not like it but then they can't ignore it and uh so so that's what I do there's also some wonderful moments um that you must have felt when the whole crowd an anonymous crowd comes together and sort of becomes one and barriers Fall Away between people um and this is what was n thought music should be doing yeah uniting us um no I know it sounds fanciful but I think it's a real phenomena and people know it when they feel it and you know wherever when you get that uh it's a magical thing and you know you you can share it maybe with musicians but once you're sharing it with the audience and they actually giving you the fuel on which you're running um you know people or you don't get any SA satisfaction from a show a concert that you feel is just going to roll the engine regardless of what you the audience do so for many years I would try and think of things that would engage the audience in different ways um you know like singing from the furthest seat from the stage walking through the audience coming in with drums or lights or it but I think that sort of barrier um can be broken through and it's much more powerful when um there's some mutual exchange going on another thing that's been Central to your life is collaborations you've collaborated perhaps more than any other musician certainly British musician um maybe I needed two more than any other musician why why do you say that no I I I think I've been smart enough you know to work with very good people what we've got a clip of one collaboration that you did um she appears on quite a lot of one of your albums shenado con yeah what Drew you to her voice um I thought it was very powerful emotional sort of from the gut feeling and that that's what I loved about it let's let's hear a little clip from in the blood of Eden I see you hold so tightly in your [Music] hand and all the while the distance crows between you and me I do not understand the of the woman and the man the man and the woman and the woman and the Man in the blood [Music] of the woman we wanted [Music] the oh the of the I've been fascinated to learn of these attempts of communicating with other life forms on the planet I mean I think we share a planet with with intelligent life you know we looking for it out there but we've got plenty here and eventually I thought well I'd love to see if there's some way of them connecting through music and I called a couple of places and the language research lab which was then in Atlanta Sue Savage Rambo who been working with bonobo apes said come on down so I went about five times and um for me it was a sort of life-changing experience and um led to another project which we're trying to get slowly going when we're I mean we're not trying to do it slowly but it's called the interspecies internet to try and allow other Minds other than human Minds access to the internet and give them the sort of tools that we have and see what they would do with them and how they would Express themselves so it's that again sounds a little fanciful but we're we're very serious about it and we have you know great scientists um there's Diana ree Neil gershenfeld from MIT and Vin surf who was one of the founders of the internet and his particular interest is that he thinks that it's ridiculous that we would be the only intelligent life in the cosmos so he expects us to meet Aliens one day and if we've had no practice learning to communicate with other species um we're starting at a disadvantage but Peter is this rooted in the idea that music is a universal language is that where it starts yeah I mean it's um I mean what had happened with the bonobas then a couple of people had sort of given them percussion instruments and that wasn't so interesting for me and I I thought maybe we could encourage them to sit at a piano keyboard and um uh and then you know they did what a three-year-old would do first and then I asked through Sue um if they could try um playing just one finger and Panisha who sadly we've now lost but she decided to interpret that as two things fingers but you'll see maybe what let's let's look at the clip and we can talk more properly I'm in the room next door which is the sort of kitchen [Music] [Music] so I'm just improvising about 6t away [Music] oh [Music] here she finds the octave [Music] [Music] yeah you did good so that was actually [Applause] yeah and and she hadn't had practice on a piano so so this was you know I think within the the first day that she was exposed to a keyboard uh and it's clear um you know particularly to musicians that she's listening really well intently and making uh distinct choices you know and just that in itself is was mindblowing um and U and she knew you know like with any improvisation you can feel whether it's good or or not connecting and she knew that too so on her keyboard in front of her she hit the good sign because she knew she she done a good job that time it's amazing we we've only scratched the surface I don't feel too bad about this because you know with someone like Peter you can only scratch the surface Peter thank you so much no my pleasure [Applause]"

    "Title": "The Pleasure of Kissing",
    "Transcript": "Mutual desire is normally signalled, by a pretty weird act. Two organs, otherwise used for eating and speaking, are rubbed and pressed against one another with increasing force. Accompanied by the secretion of saliva. A tongue normally precisely manipulated to articulate vowel sounds. Or to push mash potato or broccoli to the rear of the palate. Now moves forward to meet its counterpart, whose tip might touch in repeated staccato movements. One would have to careful explain to an alien visitor from Keppler 9B... What's going on They're not about to bite chunks out of each other cheeks Or attempting to inflate one another. Why is kissing so significant and potentially so exciting? Sexual excitement is psychological. It's not so much what our bodies happen to be doing, that's getting us turned on. It's what happening in our imagination that matters. Partly, the excitement of kissing is the result of social codes being breached. We could imagine a society where it was very forbidden, and yet very special for two people to rub the gap between index finger and thumb together. The first time you did it, would be something you'd remember all your life. The huge meaning of kissing is something we've built up by social agreement. And it's fundamental definition is: I accept you, enough to do something potentially quite revolting with you. The inside of a mouth is deeply private, ordinarily it would be utterly nauseating to have a stranger poke their tongue into your face. To allow someone to do these things, signals of a fundamental level of acceptance. All of us suffer from strong feelings of shame. Which another's kiss starts to work on overcoming. Aside from our public identities, we all have lonelier, private selves. Which is what we feel we getting and giving access to... through a kiss. Our mouths become privileged arenas. In which to surrender our defences. And gift ourselves to another. physical pleasure aside. that's why it's so very exciting."

    "Title": "Stay in - or Leave - a Relationship?",
    "Transcript": "The decision whether one should stay or leave is one of the most consequential and painful any of us ever has to make. On any given day, many millions of people worldwide will be secretly turning the issue over in their minds as they go about their daily lives. Their partners beside them, possibly having little clue as to the momentous decision weighing upon them. The choice is perhaps more common now than it ever was We expect to be deeply happy in love, and, therefore, spend a good deal of time wondering whether our relationships are essentially normal in their sexual and psychological frustrations or are beset by unusually pathological patterns which will impel us to get out as soon as we can. What films or novels we've been exposed to, the state of our friends' relationships, the degree of noise surrounding new sexually driven dating apps, not to mention how much sleep we've had can all play humblingly large roles in influencing us one way or another. Awkwardly, it seems that no one else actually really minds what we end up doing which gives the decision a degree of existential loneliness it might not always have possessed Historically, the choice was, in a sense, a good deal easier because there were simply so many stern external sanctions around not leaving: religions would insist that god blessed unions and would be furious that they're being torn asunder, society strongly disapproved of breakups and cast separating parties into decades of ignominy and shame, and psychologists would explain that children would be deeply and permanently scarred by any termination in their parents' relationship But, one by one, these objections to quitting have fallen away; religions no longer terrify us into staying society doesn't care, and psychologists now routinely tell us that children would prefer a broken family to an unhappy one The burden of choice therefore falls squarely on us. The only thing determining whether to stay or leave is how we feel which can be pretty hard matter indeed to work out for ourselves, our feelings having a dispirited habit of shifting and evading any efforts of rational qualification. In the circumstances, it might help to have a set of questions, devil's advocate in nature, to fall back upon - a kind of checklist to dialogue within one's mind in the silent hours of the morning, from the chill vantage point of the spare room couch. How much of our unhappiness can be tightly attributed to this particular partner, and how much might it, as we would risk discovering five years and multiple upheavals later, turn out to be simply and inherent feature of any attempt to live in close proximity to another human? Though it is, of course, always essentially their fault, what tiny proportion of the difficulties might we, nevertheless, be contributing to the discord? In what modest way might we be a little hard to be around? Consider the annoying traits in all previous partners we've had and people we've known that our current partners happen not to have what do we manage not to fight about? Start to probe at any new infatuations or crushes, largely by getting to know them better Observe closely how many sexually available and intelligent people the single types around us, especially those hooked up to those new dating apps actually manage to encounter day-to-day. Try to have another converstaion with your partner in which you don't accuse them of mendacity, and instead simply explain, quite calmly, how you actually feel and how sad you are at quite a few things. Reflect on how'd you really feel as a child. If henceforth, you were to have two tiny bedrooms, two new step-parents, and possibly a few more new half-siblings. Compare with the scratchy reality of the current set up. Question how normal it is for any couple to have great sex after twenty-two months. Ask yourself if you're ready to face the risk of perhaps achieving no more than exchanging a familiar kind of unhappiness for a new and more complex variety of unhappiness. Wonder whether you really want to choose hope over experience Then, if you still have the impulse to leave, the chances of subsiquent regret lessened to at least a touch, a heavy heart, and a cautious mind, leave."

    "Title": "Why People Have Affairs",
    "Transcript": "Too often, affairs are seen as the outcome of random horniness or just plain old nastiness, but that's very rarely the case. When it comes to affairs, we spend far too long being incensed or secretive and far too little time trying to understand. In truth, affairs stem from a very fiddly aspect of our romantic psychology. In relationships with a partner, all of us need carefully calibrated mixtures of two different ingredients. We have a need for closeness and a need for distance. We want to impart closeness: to feel we can hug, touch, be cosy, intimate and entirely relaxed and at home with someone. We want them to know our thoughts and to wander freely in their minds too. But we also need distance enough not to feel cloyingly submerged, subsumed or owned by another. We want to retain a sense of freedom, we need a private room to which we alone have the key. Any imbalances towards over-closeness or over-distance may prove catastrophic if left unaddressed. In a relationship which threatens to lean perilously towards over-closeness we can be driven to strain a powerful urge to prove to ourselves that not everything we do and are is owned by the partner, that we remain desirable to the world and a going concern in and of ourselves. Going to bed with a new person might not simply be about lust, it's about escaping the alarming feeling that one's whole identity appears to be on the verge of dissolving into the couple. But too much distance can undermine fidelity no less powerfully. The distance reads like constant rejection: when we try to touch the partner, they move away or sigh. When we bring up something personal, they change the subject. We may end up having an affair not because we don't love the partner anymore, but precisely because we do. And yet the distance they appear to be imposing on us, through their lack of engagement, feels unendurable and humiliating. It's the final irony, but if caught would be accused of not caring, when it was caring too much that might have inspired the whole mistaken escapade. Tragically, two people almost never enter a relationship with the same needs for distance or closeness, that's why in every couple we hear the accusation that one person is too clingy and another is too cold. These are unhelpfully vicious words for what are, at heart, just two different ways of feeling comfortable in love. It's therefore an early imperative in any relationship to work out what the relative needs for distance and closeness actually are to air the disjuncture not to get angry about it, and mutually and with good humour to apologise for ones distinctive contribution to it. Only thus can we hope to ensure that the gap won't lead in an online chat, at a bar or at a conference to a situation where only an affair feels like a plausible solution to the vexing problems of distance and closeness."

    "Title": "POLITICAL THEORY - John Locke",
    "Transcript": "The 17th century English philosopher, John Locke, is to be remembered for his wise and brilliant contributions to three great issues that continue to concern us to this day: how we should educate our children, who should rule over us, and what we should do about people who have different religious ideas to us. Locke was born into a quiet Somerset village in 1632. He was 10 years old when the English civil war broke out, and his father became captain in the parliamentary army. King Charles I was publicly executed in 1649, just a few feet away from where Locke was studying: at Westminster School. The screams of the crowds heard in the library marked him deeply. Locke went on to study medicine at Oxford and planned to be a doctor, but his life changed significantly when, by chance, he became acquainted with the dashing and highly ambitious Greek politician, Antony Ashley Cooper-- known as the \"First Earl of Shaftesbury,\" who'd come to Oxford to look for a cure for a liver disease he had. Cooper suggested that Locke move to London to become part of his household. The offer was hard to resist, and once part of Cooper's entourage, Locke began to participate in the great scientific, educational, religious, and political debates of the day. Along the way, he also helped to cure Shaftesbury of his liver complaint, earning his lifelong gratitude. The first question Locke grew fascinated by, was what to do with people who don't agree with your religious views. In breaking away from the Catholic Church under Henry VIII in the 16th century, English Protestantism had started a process of noisy questioning of religion that couldn't now easily be stopped. Because this was threatening to get out of hand, there were arguments that there should be total government control over religion, and a hard crack down on dissenters. But Locke became one of the foremost advocates of freedom of belief in his beautiful, essay concerning toleration, written in 1667. Here, he advocated toleration on the basis of three points. Firstly, 'because Earthly judges, the state in particular, and human beings in general, cannot dependably evaluate the truth-claims of competing religious standpoints.' Secondly, 'even if they could, enforcing a single \"true religion\" would never work, because you can't be compelled into belief through violence.' And thirdly, 'coercing religious uniformity leads to far more social disorder than allowing diversity.' Locke argued that the ultimate aim of the state was just to preserve the quiet and comfortable living of men in society, but that it'd have nothing to do with the good of men's souls. Religion was a personal choice, and churches were voluntary organizations, which could set their own rules and be left to it. It was thanks to Locke's influence, that the idea of locking up people for their beliefs fell entirely out of favor. By the 18th century, other European nations looked with envy at England; a place where what you happen to believe was simply deemed irrelevant to your statues or prospects. This was a truly remarkable achievement for one book, by one man to have set in train, but Locke didn't stop there. In 1689, he published a second extraordinary book; The Two Treatises of Government. This tried to answer the question of  who should rule the country and on what legitimate bases. One common yet increasingly fanciful notion at the time, was that political authority derived directly from God. But a more recent explanation from Thomas Hobbes had asserted that the totalitarian power of kings was justified by their ability to keep order and prevent repetitions of the chaos that had rained; Hobbes had insisted, in the time before powerful governments and that he had called; the state of nature. By painting the state of nature in the darkest colors, Hobbes had asked his readers to set themselves low expectations, for what a decent ruler was meant to be. Anything better than the savagery of the Stone Age was legitimate, and rulers have no responsibility to guarantee religious freedom or human rights. But now, in the First Treatise, Locke thoroughly demolished the Scriptural claim; that God had created kings. And in the Second Treatise, he took on Hobbes's ideas about the state of nature. Locke agreed with Hobbes that before without government, there would have been a State of Nature. But he disagreed what this place would actually have been like, he argued; that it would have been broadly peaceful, and that in agreeing to summit to governments, people have therefore not, fearfully agreed to surrender all their rights. In fact, they possessed a range of alienable or natural rights that no ruler could ever take away."

    "Title": "HISTORY OF IDEAS - French & English Gardens",
    "Transcript": "There have been two central traditions in European gardening. Each one associated with a great European nation. The first originated in 17th century France, and became known as the \"Jardin à la française\" or \"formal French garden\". The most sublime example of this school of gardening is to be found in the chateau of Vaux-le-Vicomte which is about 50 kilometers southeast of Paris. It was laid out in the late 1650s by André le Nôtre the most important figure in the history of the French Garden. And the son of the gardener of Louis XIII. The idea was to arrange everything around symmetry, flattening the existing natural landscape so as to create perfect arrangements of borders, flower beds and reflecting pools. A grand perspective, a thousand five hundred meters long extended from the foot of the chateau to the end point: a statue of Hercules. The alleyways were decorated at regular intervals by statues, basins fountains and carefully sculpted topiaries. It was in an extremely logical precise unyielding way perfect . Another masterpiece of French gardening was then constructed at Versailles also by André Le Nôtreto. Here to there was astonishing symmetry and a will to bend the unruliness of nature to the designs of man. The French gardening tradition achieved enormous popularity and was widely copied in far more modest homes across Europe for a century at least. But the dominance eventually gave way to a new theory of gardening that developed in England in the 18th century. And was known as the \"Jardin à l'anglaise\" or \"English Garden\". The central figure in this tradition was Capability Brown, a gardener of genius responsible for a 170 gardens up and down the United Kingdom, including Petworth in West Sussex, Chatsworth and Darbyshire Bowood in Wilshire and Blenheim Palace  in Oxfordshire. The Jardin à l'anglaise couldn't have been more different from the Jardin à la française. In the English tradition everything was about working with rather than flattening natural features . Wildness of nature wasn't the enemy. It was the starting point which the skilled English gardener would enhance and work with. A good English garden relish the raw impulses of nature it was about accommodating and delighting in nature even though this was nature that was tampered with in order to get it to look just that bit more natural. The English garden usually included a lake, sweeps of gently rolling lawns and groves of trees. The English tradition reign supreme for a century at least. These are two historical traditions of gardening but they are also along the way two modes of being. The French style is about a confident rationalism and willpower. This is how we might feel when we want to change the world through thought and planning. The English tradition is about accommodating ourselves to what already exists, bending with what is there, trying to make the most out of what we've been given and to see its beauty and its charm. It looks like a battle but ideally we need the two attitudes, the French and the English in our lives in order to call upon them in diverse situations. Each of us is probably a bit biased towards one or the other and could benefit from seeking out the distinctive wisdom of either the French or the English style. The opposition of the to gardening styles is stark but in truth we need integration, the Jardin à la française and the Jardin à l'anglaise, rational willpower and acceptance of nature. There are in fact a few places that do show the two integrated like Sissinghurst Garden in Kent which borrows from both traditions. This shows us the model of how an ideal individual might be, someone with a French and an English garden sight to their nature. Ready to call upon either faculty depending on the occasion. That would be interesting gardening and wise psychology."

    "Title": "POP CULTURE: Pop and Philosophy",
    "Transcript": "When pop music started in a big way in the 1960s, it seemed at times like an especially silly medium, favoured by hormonal school girls and connected up with delinquent and tedious and bizarre behaviour. \"Have you tried to sneak in the hotel?\" \"Yes.\" \"Yes, we were in the hotel.\" \"How far in did you get?\" \"Twelfth floor.\" By contrast, Philosophy had a reputation for being deeply serious and impressive - the natural home of the big ambition to understand ourselves and transform the world through ideas. But since the 1960's, philosophy has stalled, and pop has conquered the world. It's now the foremost medium for the articulation of ideas on a mass scale. This explains why, if it's to survive, philosophy must study pop. Part of its salvation lies in understanding pop's techniques, so as to be able to become, in crucial ways, a little more like it. There are a host of critical lessons that philosophy can learn from pop. For a start, pop teaches us about charm. The great pop songs are the witchingly, dazzlingly charming in the manner in which they get their messages across. They know exactly how to wear away our defences and enter our imaginations with grace. It's a reminder that it isn't enough for ideas to be correct for them to become powerful and deliver on their promises; they need to know how to win over an audience. Pop is the most seductive force the world has ever known. It has more and more devoted adherents than all the religions put together. It's more deeply loved; more trusted; and a more constant companion in our joys and sorrows than any other artform. Pop has become powerful in part because it's cleverly understood the division of labour. Those who can sing and hold the crowd may not be the same as those who know how to write music or arrange the instruments. Pop is unashamed about uniting talent wherever it finds it, so that the final result combines in this beautiful face with the finest voice; the best score and the most beguiling Instrumental arrangement. Pop has overcome the romantic hang-up about the unique creator. It knows that the most intimate heartfelt results may be the outcome of large-scale institutional collaboration. [MUSIC: Royals - Lorde] Pop teaches us too about compression. It knows our lives are busy and has an extraordinarily ambitious sense of what could be achieved in under three minutes. Like all other artforms, pop is trying to communicate ideas, but it bypasses the more resistant intellectual parts of the mind. All the usual obstacles to reaching another person are stripped away in the name of visceral intimacy. Pop achieves what Pericles, Lincoln Dickens, and Proust were attempting, and spectacularly exceeds all of them. It provides the ultimate demonstration of the 19th Century theorist Walter Pater's tantalising assertion that \"all art aspires to the condition of music\". Like religion, pop knows that repetition is key. It works its effect through being heard again and again. It would prefer to grab three minutes from you every day, than three hours every few months. Like religious incantation, it's interested in working upon our souls cumulatively. Pop is intelligent in not being afraid of simplicity. It's too wise to be held back by pedantry or erudition It knows that our emotional needs are in essence obvious to be encouraged to be held to be jolly to be Reassured when we're alone to be told something beautiful and uplifting It doesn't suffer from high arts perverse addiction to subtlety it accepts that the core of our minds may be astonishing basic in Structure does Pop is ultimately the master of collective, Euphoria it possesses What churches and politicians would like but are so rarely able to secure? It's worked out how to generate shared moments of deep emotion about important things In the stadium the singer functions as a high priest for whom the flock might be ready to make major sacrifices They would in [that] benign Frenzy be willing to go just about anywhere That philosophy needs to learn from Pop doesn't preclude that pop [leads] of course to learn quite a bit from Philosophy as well Pop currently touches on the big themes, but doesn't as yet properly take up many of the opportunities that lie its way It's lacking in ultimate ambitions in the future. We need pop musicians to take up the challenge of investigating the deepest truths of getting behind Transformative concepts and of making these into the things we'll sing about in front of the bathroom mirror With our hair brushes so that they become a background sounds of our inner lives the world awaits from a redemptive synthesis between philosophy and pop you you"

    "Title": "The Uses of Envy",
    "Transcript": "From a young age we're talked it's a terrible thing, so when we feel it As we all do, we're inclined not to examine it. We just feel ashamed and guilty. But that's a pity. Because envy, like fear, is an important emotion that exists in all of us for some good reasons. It's there to help us know what we want. It's a call to action that should be heeded containing garbled but important messages about what we should be doing with the rest of our lives. If we can get past the humiliation of envious feelings we can start to see them as a set of clues about what we might do next. We should study and maybe even record on paper the situation and people that make us envious. We might learn to keep an envy diary, it will contain a fragment of a future self trying to break through. We often forget that the things we admire don't just belong to one specific very attractive life. They can be pursued in lesser, weaker, but still very real doses in countless other places. Opening up the possibility of creating many smaller, more manageable and more realistic versions of the lives we are drawn to. Let's no longer just think we're bad people just for envying. Let's do something far more productive, become diligent and careful students of our most persistent envious feelings. They're trying to tell us something, and we should listen."

    "Title": "The Horrors of Children",
    "Transcript": "They are extremely sweet, of course, and, on a good day, very rewarding. But let's be clear about some other things that our child-centered societies never dare to mention, but should, because the silence stops us from understanding what the business of having children is really all about. There's not very much honest intergenerational transfer of information here... for the same reason there isn't around the great, dark truths of love. We're simply too ashamed of our own difficulties. We shouldn't be. The job of culture is to reveal what friends never tell you, that everyone, privately, ends up thinking. So here... a sum of the big secrets. Having children destroys your relationship as a romantic, sexual concern. People say you get closer over the kids, but this isn't the emotional, let alone, sexual intimacy we'd want. It's more like the team spirit you'd get between colleagues in a busy kindergarten. It's almost a biological law: kids will kill the relationship that produced them. We've bought into the idea that all the problems people might have from their childhoods come down to the fact that their parents were mean or neglectful. Be nice to your kids - psychologists tell us - and all will be well. But that's turned out to be pretty misleading. As a parent, you will allways have to put an end to a lot of the fun. It starts with computers and gets worse from there, for the sake of protecting your kids, and you will be hated profoundly as a result. Indeed, the more you love them, the more you can act in their long-term interests and the more hated you'll be at points. Unlike all those fun loving parents, whose lack of care buys them short-term votes. The more you love your child and make them feel safe, the more they'll use you as a punchbag when things go wrong in their lives. All those assurances - I'll always be on your side - will pay off beautifully. They will encourage your child to direct their every frustration and disappointment onto the loving adult who signaled that they can, and will, take it. The dream is that you'll be able to pass some insights to your children, - let's say around money, or career, or love - insights that you accumulated through painful experience, and thereby you'll save them time. But sadly the human race is very commited to reexploring every dumb error in every new generation. You can't spare people time. Modern parents want to make things so nice for their kids. But we know from our own experience that we have a key moments grown-up only through things that have a painful side to them. We desperately want our children to grow mature, but without going through awful things. They can't. Kids will need to separate themselves from you; it's a biological imperative. You can't live at home forever. But unfortunately, that urge for separation has a habit of expressing itself very meanly in the period we call 'adolescence'. It means finding parents repeatedly ridicolous and silly and trashing your life's goals and values. Despite all the hard work your kids will end up mediocre. You might have thought that all the early lessons and care and love... will turn them into a version of Mozart or Tolstoj. It won't. They'll be very average people who'll have demanded way, way, above average levels of commitment from you to get them to adulthood. Many people who learn they can't have children are deeply unhappy. Dont' worry. Have children and you will, at times, definitely regret it. Don't have children and you will, at times, also definitely regret it Both sides are just interestingly, and differently, miserable. But neither side has very much to envy from the other."

    "Title": "EASTERN PHILOSOPHY - Kintsugi",
    "Transcript": "Though we may keep a little quiet about this, especially when young, we tend deep down to be rather hopeful that we will eventually manage to find perfection in a number of areas. We dream of one day securing an ideally harmonious relationship; deeply fulfilling work, a happy family life, and the respect of others. But life has a habit of dealing us a range of blows and leaving nothing much of this array of fine dreams save some shattered and worthless fragments. It's at moments of disillusion that we might turn our minds to a concept drawn from Japanese Philosophy and in particular from the Zen Buddhist approach to ceramics. Over the centuries zen masters developed an argument that pots, cups, and bowls that had become damaged shouldn't simply be neglected or thrown away. They should continue to attract our respect and attention and be repaired with enormous care. This process symbolizing a reconciliation with the floors and accidents of time intended to reinforce some underlying themes in zen. The word given to this tradition of ceramic repair is Kin Tsugi. Kin: Golden, Tsugi: joinery. It means quite literally to \"join with gold\". In Zen aesthetics the broken pieces of an accidentally smashed pot should be carefully picked up reassembled and then glued together with lacquer inflected with the most expensive gold powder. There should be no attempt to disguise the damage. The point is to render the fault lines beautiful and strong. The precious veins of gold are there to emphasize that breaks have a philosophical merit all of their own. The origins of Kin Tsugi are set a date the Muromachi Period, when the shogun of Japan, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, broke his favourite tea bowl, and distraught, sent it to be repaired in China. But on its return, he was horrified by the ugly, metal staples that had been used to join the broken pieces and charged his craftsmen with devising a more appropriate solution. What they came up with was a method that didn't disguise the damage, but made something properly artful out of it. Kintsugi belongs to the zen ideals of 'Wabi Sabi', which cherishes what's simple, unpretentious, and aged. Especially if it has a rustic, or weathered quality. A story is told of one of the great proponents of Wabi Sabi, Sen No Rikyu. On a journey through southern Japan, he was once invited to a dinner where the host thought he will be impressed by an elaborate and expensive antique tea jar that he had bought from China. but Rikyu didn't even seem to notice this item and instead spent his time chatting and admiring a branch swaying in the breeze outside. In despair at his lack of interest, once Rikyu had left, the devastated host  smashed the jar to pieces and retired to his room But the other guests more wisely gathered the fragments and stuck them together through Kintsugi. When Rikyu next came to visit, the philosopher turned to the repaired jar and with a knowing smile exclaimed, \"Now, it's magnificent.\" In an age that worships youth, perfection, and the new, the art of Kintsugi retains a particular wisdom as applicable to our own lives as it is to pots: That care and love expended on the shattered pieces should also encourage us to respect what is damaged and scarred, vulnerable and imperfect, starting with ourselves and those around us."

    "Title": "The Joy of Sexting",
    "Transcript": "One of the big ongoing misconceptions we have is that sex might be something that happens in our bodies... when it is, of course, overwhelmingly an intellectual business rooted in the mind. Perhaps nothing proves this so well as the business of sexting, a highly creative activity in which two people, who may be on opposite continents from one another, can nevertheless, through the sheer medium of words, bring each other off without so much as a single touch of the skin. Like any good writer, the sexter must create profound effects in another's mind nearly through the manipulation of the alphabet. Though that the goal is also to provoke orgasm, arguably places a demand for visceral literary talent almost as great as that required by a National Book Award or Pulitzer Prize. Eroticism emerges first and foremost from the pleasure – in which relief plays a big part – at having our secret sexual selves, witnessed, endorsed and encouraged by a kindly other. The good sexter knows how to call forth the otherwise shamed, shy parts of their partner and to lead them to lay aside the punishing propriety that society normally demands. So-called dirty words have an important role to play in successful texting, for their taboo nature functions as evidence of loyalty and trust. We can say polite things to more or less anyone; but it's only around someone rather special that we can at last spill out the plethora of extreme things that we've known since childhood we must never utter. They may sound like the opposite of tenderness, but the dirtiest words are in fact touching symbols of loyalty and emotional intimacy. They are evidence that we've at last found someone to whom we can reveal our true wayward selves, without guilt. In the heat of sexting, we no longer have to care about being those rather oppressive titles: a good boy or a nice girl. While the city sleeps, swear words, insults, extreme longings, all travel down oblivious fiber optic cables. Orbiting satellites will eavesdrop on the details of fantasies of cunnilingus. What our phone companies will later in the month discretely refer to as merely 'data' bears the imprint of excited journeys, from loneliness to the deepest intimacy. It's no more fair to dismiss texting because many people have done it without artistry than to dismiss all works of literature because there have been so many substandard books. Sexting awaits rediscovery as a supreme medium of literary talent. An honest and poignant comunication."

    "Title": "Why We Love to Blame Our Partners",
    "Transcript": "One of the odder phenomena of relationships is the immediate certainty that whenever things go wrong in our lives it is first and foremost, and quite obviously, our partner's fault. We get furious with our partners because we assign them such a deep role in our lives. We have faith that a person who understands obscure parts of us, whose presence solves so many of our problems, couldn't realistically also be someone who wouldn't be able to fix our whole lives. We exaggerate our partners' powers, an exaggeration that's an echo – heard in adult life down the decades – of a child's awe at their parents. The partner inherits a little of that beautiful, romantic, dangerous, unfair, trust we as children once had in our parents. At one level, the lover has learnt how to reassure the anxious child in us – that's why we love them. But that source of strength also brings with it some very serious problems, for the primitive part of us insists on trusting them a little too much, believing that they actually control far more of existence than they possibly could. It's also to do with the permission that the partner's love gives us... to moan in a way we cannot otherwise. The world is constantly mean to us. It rejects our creative endeavours, it overlooks us in promotions, it rewards idiots. But usually we can't complain. We can't get angry with the people who are really to blame for hurting us. So, we get angry with those whom we can be sure will tolerate us for blaming them. We get angry with the very nicest, most sympathetic, most loyal people in our vicinity, the ones least likely to have harmed us, but most likely to stick around while we blame them furiously for having done so. The mean words and mad accusations we mutter to our lovers undoubtedly often sound horrible. But let's at least remember that they are a curious proof of intimacy, a symptom of love itself – and in their own way, oddly romantic (a detail indirectly acknowledged by their frequently sexual conclusions). We can tell any stranger something reasonable and polite, but only in the presence of someone we really trust can we dare to be properly irrational and truly unkind. If we think of love as being in perfect agreement all the time, we will feel that getting into fights must mean that a relationship is winding down or starting to fall apart. But crazy blame games are at heart just a symptom of an intensity of investment in another person. We aren't simply nice with our partners, because we are so very close to them. They draw us into very private zones of turbulence and distress... from which absolutely everyone else is excluded. That's one of the stranger, more unfortunate and yet (from a calm angle) almost flattering gifts of love."

    "Title": "POP CULTURE: When and Why We Cry In Films",
    "Transcript": "It's normal to think that we'll cry when sad stuff happens on screen, when a character we've come to like dies, when a relationship we wanted to believe in falls apart, when a favorite animal doesn't make it. Of course, we do sometimes shed tears here, but the odd thing is, especially the older we get, we start crying not when things are horrible - one toughens up a little - but when they're suddenly, and unexpectedly, precisely the opposite. When they're unusually sweet, tender, joyful, innocent, or kind. \"And the little one is Beatrice.\" \"Oh, Beatrice, she's got mischievous glint in her eye, doesn't she?\" \"Yeah, unbelievable.\" \"Forgot napkins.\" \"Okay, 33 seconds.\" For example, when a rather gruff, distant father shows vulnerability, \"I'm proud of you, Flint.\" \"I'm amazed that someone as ordinary as me\" \"could be the father of someone as extraordinary as you.\" when two lovers who'd been rowing make it up, when a child says something incredibly sweet and innocent, \"I'm really good.\" when someone is so tender with somebody else. Far more than grimness, it's a particular grace and loveliness which can, for a moment, feel heart breaking. We're crying not because something sad has happened on the screen, but because what's so lovely on screen is nudging us to realize, semi-consciously, that some pretty sad things have been happening in our lives. The loveliness is drawing our attention to some of the struggles we face, and to some of the things we really want, but are finding it so hard to get: reconciliation, forgiveness, tenderness, an end to the fighting, a chance to say sorry. We start to cry at a brief vision of a state of grace from which we're exiled most of the time. We ache for all the lost innocence of the world. Loveliness and goodness can make the actual ugliness of our existence all the more vivid. That's also why, if we were to consider the unusual project of creating a robot that could cry at the movies, we would have to do something apparently rather cruel. We would have to ensure that this robot knew all about suffering, for it's only against a background of pain that beautiful scenes in films become deeply moving, rather than merely nice. Our tears are telling us something key, that our lives are tougher than they used to be we were little, and that our longing for uncomplicated niceness and goodness is, correspondingly, all the more intense. [choir singing] \"But when Johnny lifts her at the end...\" \"No, I know, it's a very... it's a great movie.\" \"If you tell anyone I'll kill you.\" \"Yeah, understood, yeah, hundred percent.\""

    "Title": "LITERATURE - Goethe",
    "Transcript": "People have always had trouble pronouncing his name. If you don't speak German, it's not at all obvious how you're supposed to say it. A safe bet is to start with a hard G on Ger- and end with a -ter: Ger-ter. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe has often been seen as one of Europe's big cultural heroes, comparable to the likes of Shakespeare, Dante, and Homer. During his life, Goethe's admirers were impressed by his literary works. But more than any of his books, what impressed people at the time, was how he lived his life, the kind of person he was. We can pick up some vital lessons from him: 1. Stop being so romantic Goethe's first proper job after law school was as an assistant at a national tribunal, judging cases between the many minor German states that, at that time, made up the Holy Roman Empire. While he was working, Goethe fell in love with the fiance of one of his colleagues. He then committed a huge indiscretion and wrote up the love affair as an novel. He called it, \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\". The central character, Werther, is a lightly disguised self-portrait. The book tells the story of how Werther/Goethe falls in love with a young woman, Charlotte. It's a very detailed description of all the tiny steps one takes on the road to infatuation. They danced together. At one point, their feet accidentally touch under the table. They smile, they write each other flirtatious little notes. It makes being in love seem like the most romantic experience in life. Werther asks himself, \"What is a life without romantic love? A magical lantern without a lamp\". This deeply charming novel was a best-seller across Europe for the next 25 years. Napoleon boasted he'd read it seven times. The story has a miserable ending. Charlotte doesn't really love Werther and finally rejects him. In despair, he kills himself. The tragic denouement shows Goethe beginning to see the limitations of the romantic view of life. Romantic love is deeply attractive, but it causes us immense problems too. The core problem, as Goethe came to see it, is this: Romantic love hopes to freeze a beautiful moment. It's a summer's evening after dinner, Werther is walking in the woods with his beloved; He wants it to be always like this. So he feels they should get married, have a house together, have children; Though in reality, marriage will be nothing at all like the lovely June night. There'll be exhaustion, bills to pay, squabbles, and a sense of confinement. By comparison, with the extreme hopes of Romanticism, real love, as Goethe came to see, is always, necessarily, a terrible disappointment. That's why Goethe gradually moved away from Romanticism towards an ideology of love he termed \"Classicism\", marked by a degree of pessimism and acceptance of the troubles that afflict all couples over time, and of the need to abandon some of the heady hopes of the early days for the sake of tranquility and administrative competence. Goethe was a critic of Romantic ideology, not because he was cold-hearted or lacking in imagination, but because he so deeply and intimately understood the attractions of Romanticism. And therefore its dangers. 2. Get a real job In April 1775, not long after his big success with Werther Goethe got a job as a civil servant. Karl August, the Duke of Weimar, appointed him as his chief adviser and senior administrator to help run his country. Goethe continued in this employment for most of the rest of his life. His main jobs was Minister for Roads and as the overseer of the state-owned silver mining operation. It can sound like a strange move for a very successful creative figure, as if the winner of the Booker Prize became a civil servant. We just assume that art and literature are at odds with an enthusiasm for government administration. But Goethe didn't see it that way. He felt that understanding administration would help him put big ideas into practice. Later in his life, instead of writing about how good it would be to have a national theater, he was able to establish one, and instead of just saying that cities should have green spaces, he was able to rev up the governmental machinery into action and actually create a model urban park. 3. Travel as therapy In September 1786, after 10 years in the Weimar civil service, when his 40th birthday was coming into view, Goethe got fed up with Germany: the cold, the bad food, and this was key for him, the lack of sex. So, he went to Rome with a very classical idea of the point of travel. The outer journey was intended to support an inner journey towards maturity. He felt that there were parts of himself that could only be discovered in Italy. But, like many visitors to Rome, when he got there, he felt a bit disappointed. In the famous book of poems he later wrote about his experience, the Roman Elegies; he describes how the great city seemed to be filled with lifeless ruins that were famous but didn't actually mean anything to him. \"Speak to me, you stones!\", he pleads. It's a feeling many later visitors have had. Goethe realized that what he needed was not a more elaborate guidebook, but the right person to have an affair with, someone who would embody the spirit of the place he was in. In his poems he describes the woman he meets, whom he calls Faustina. They spend lazy afternoons in bed. She's not a great intellectual, but she breathes the spirit of Rome. She tells him about her life, about the building she passes on her way to the market, the Pantheon, a Baroque church designed by Bernini, which she hadn't even realized were famous. They were just the buildings that happened to be around when she was getting the milk and the aubergines. For Goethe, the point of travel isn't relaxation or just taking a break from routine. He had a bigger goal in mind. The aim of travel is to go to a place, where we can find a missing ingredient of our own maturity. 4. Living Life to the Fullest One of the most striking things about Goethe is how much he did, how broad his horizons were, and how wide his interest came to be; He explored this particularly through his most famous work, Faust. Goethe worked on Faust all his life, the earliest sketches go back to his teens. And he only decided he was done with it when he was in his early 80s. Faust comes in two parts and together, the performance takes about 13 hours. Goethe himself never saw the whole thing and few people have ever since. Faust is a medieval academic and scholar. He's very learned, but he doesn't do very much. He's unfulfilled in love, he hasn't made any money, and he has no power. His knowledge is sterile, his life feels pointless, and he wishes he could die. But then he is visited by a devil, called Mephistopheles, who offers him boundless energy, good looks, and the ability to do whatever he wants. The question is: what will Faust want to do? The first danger for Faust is to just stay an academic who resists worldly impact. With the Devil's help, he could be the ultimate bookworm. He could get his hands on the oldest rarest manuscripts. But, Faust gets weary of words and longs for action. Now the second danger is that he will use his new powers to gratify every sensual appetite. He might become just a pure hedonist. Faust goes some way down this path. He goes to a bar and gets everyone very drunk, he goes to huge orgy. But then he realises that what he really seeks is beauty and love. And this leads him on from sex and alcohol. The third danger is that Faust will become a confident, but shallow political leader. But in the second part of the play, Faust pursues a grander purpose. Eventually he organises the development of a new country, somewhat reminiscent of the Dutch Republic, which at that time was the most enlightened and successful society in the world. Faust is a morality tale for all of us. He shows us both the pitfalls of life and how we might avoid them. Faust knows a great deal, but he resists being an academic. He love sex, but he doesn't give way to debauchery. He likes power but he doesn't use it for megalomania. He puts it to work in the service of noble ends. Faust's career path is not unlike Goethe's. Faust is essentially tracing for us a theory of how to live a full life. He's very interested in ideas, but not a scholar. He visits Italy, but he doesn't stay there. He goes back to work. He tries out administration and learns how to wield power. But once he's mastered this side of himself, he moves on. The Faustian idea is that in order to develop fully, we have to flirt with things that are quite dangerous, but hold on to a sense of higher purpose. 5. Science for Artsy People Goethe was the last European to do a certain kind of remarkable things: to write great novels and plays, and also to play a significant role in science. His interest ranged through geology, meteorology, physiology, and chemistry. And his most important work was in botany. In 1790, he produced a study, The Metamorphosis of Plants, and a book on optics and colour, called The Theory of Colours, was published in 1810. Thereafter, this combination of very significant work in the arts and in the sciences disappears from the European civilization. Goethe gives us some guidance as to why this has happened. He's a hero for people of a more literary and artistic sensibility, who are attracted from a distance to the broad subject matter of science, but who find the details a bit less appealing. Goethe liked science that you can do yourself, by looking carefully at the world around you. For example, he did a lot of his research on plants in his own back garden in Weimar. He did a lot of his research on optics with candles and colored pieces of paper in his study. He liked the training this gave in asking oneself \"What do I actually see?\" Goethe was very interested in the psychological aspect of our relationship to the sorts of things that science investigates: plants, light, stones. Rather than exclude the issues of personal meaning, Goethe sees these essential to the proper and full investigation of nature. Goethe was worried by the direction that science was taking, which he particularly associated with the work of Isaac Newton. As Goethe saw it, the academic professional scientist wasn't interested in a personal meaning of the things they were investigating, and thereby, helped to kill the subject. As he aged, Goethe kept on working. And he kept on seeking love and sex. In his 70s, he fell in love with a woman called Ulkrike. His passion was unrequited. He died at his house in Weimar in 1832, aged 83. We have so much to learn from him. We don't often hear people declaring a wish to be a little more like Goethe. But if we did, the world would definitely be a more vibrant and humane place."

    "Title": "Panic Attacks",
    "Transcript": "Therapy stories: Panic Attacks Therapy is one of the most useful inventions of the last 100 years. Through conversations with a therapist, people have a chance to understand themselves better and to lead happier less anxious lives. Here is a true story from therapy. Out of the blue, in his 28th year, Zack began to develop panic attacks at the most inconvenient moments: at an office presentation, or a business networking event he'd feel extraordinarily anxious, get an urge to run away, and often need to find a bathroom very fast. It started to become hugely debilitating for Zack, who worked in a rather unforgiving, fast moving, tech company in San Fransisco. A friend recommended a therapist. It was pretty weird to find himself on a therapist's couch. He'd never had much time for the idea of therapy. The first thing the therapist told him was that here, in this room, he could panic just about as much as he liked and it wasn't going to be a problem. He could run away, faint, be sick, as all fine by her. That helped immensely. They began talking about what some of these panic attacks might have in common. It was actually deeply refreshing to talk to someone who didn't keep interrupting or shifting the agenda, someone who just kept the focus on what he was feeling and try to decode it for him. Something struck Zack as he spoke: the panic he felt had a habit of arising whenever there were expectations on him. Whenever people were waiting for him to be impressive, clever, or decisive in some way and there was a chance to make himself look like a fool or a jerk. It was as though one part of him was deliberately undermining and sabotaging the other whenever there was a opportunity to shine or triumph. \"If it carries on like this, I'll have no option but to head back home a live with my parents.\" remarked Zack, darkly one day towards the end of a session. That turned out to be the start of a very fruitful line of discussion. Zack had grown up in rural Minnesota. His father was a roofer. Neither of his parents had been to college. He'd been the bright one who'd flown the nest. The gap between Zack and his parents was now huge: he might earn in 1 year what his father earned in 5. The more Zack told the therapist about his background, the more he realized what a burden of guilt he was carrying around with him. The guilt: that success was leading him to succeed his parents in a way that was at once exciting and properly frightening. Zack wanted success but being successful was also threatening to separate him from the 2 people who he felt the greatest debt to. The panic attacks seemed like a devilish way to stay faithful to his parents. It was like an act of self sabotage, calculated to protect the parents, and especially, the father, who had some competitive and envious sides to his otherwise warm nature; all this from the risks of humiliation. It was as though in one part of his mind, Zack didn't believe he could be both an impressive adult and a loyal son. Discovering this about himself helped Zack a lot. Gradually the symptoms lessened. He learnt how to understand himself for wanting not to have the life his parents had had, and to forgive himself for looking for something better. At the same time, he accepted that he could remain loving and admiring of many qualities his parents had, and that those around him in the tech scene often didn't. Zack continued in therapy for a year. The attacks stopped completely without any need for medication. It was as if part of his mind had been listened to and no longer felt the need to ruin Zack's life in order to be heard. Recently, Zack was invited to address a conference of 2,000 delegate. The speech went perfectly."

    "Title": "PLATO ON: The Allegory of the Cave",
    "Transcript": "The ancient Greeks were emphatic that philosophy was not just an elaborate abstract exercise. It was, they felt, a deeply useful skill that should be learned and practiced by all, in order to help us to live and die well. No one believed this more than Plato. Who was passionate in his defense of philosophy as a kind of therapy for the soul. One of the most forceful stories he told on behalf of the utility of philosophy Was what has become known as \"The Allegory of the Cave\". It is perhaps the most famous allegory in philosophy. This was a story that was intended, as he wrote, to compare \"[t]he effect of education and the lack of it on our nature.\" At the start of Book 7 of his masterpiece, \"The Republic\", Plato tells us about some people living imprisoned in a cave They've always lived there and don't know anything of the outside world. There is no natural light in this cave, the walls are damp and dark All the inhabitants can see comes from the shadows of things thrown up on the wall by a light of a fire The cave dwellers get fascinated by these reflections of animals, plants and people Moreover, they assume that these shadows are real and that if you pay a lot of attention to them you'll understand and succeed in life And they don't, of course, realize that they are looking at mere phantoms They chat about shadowy things enthusiastically and take great pride in their sophistication and wisdom Then one day, quite by chance, someone discovers a way out of the cave out into the open air At first, it's simply overwhelming. He is dazzled by the brilliant sunshine In which everything is, for the first time, properly illuminated Gradually his eyes adjust and he encounters the true forms of all those things which he had formerly know only as shadows He sees actual flowers, the colors of birds, the nuances in the bark of trees He observes stars and grasps the vastness and sublime nature of the universe As Plato puts it in solemn terms: Out of compassion, this newly enlightened man decides to leave the sunlit upper world and makes his way back into the cave to try to help out his companions who are still mired in confusion and error Because he's become used to the bright upper world, he can hardly see anything underground He stumbles along the damp wet corridors and gets confused He seems to the others totally unimpressive When he in turn is unimpressed by them and insists on explaining what the sun is or what a real tree is like The cave dwellers get sarcastic, then very angry and eventually plot to kill him The story of the cave is an allegory of the life of all enlightened people The cave dwellers are humans before philosophy The sun is the light of reason The alienation of the returned philosopher is what all truth tellers can expect when they take their knowledge back to people who have not devoted themselves to thinking For Plato, we are all for much of our lives in shadow Many of the things we get excited about, like fame, the perfect partner, a high status job are infinetly less real than we suppose they are for the most part phantoms projected by our culture onto the walls of our fragile and flawed minds but because everyone around us is insisting that they are genuine we are taken in from a young age It's not our fault individually No one chooses to be in the cave That's just where we happen to begin We're all starting from a very difficult place If, like the man in Plato's story, you bluntly tell people they're wrong You get nowhere, you cause deep offense and may endanger your own life Athens had, after all, recently put Socrates, Plato's friend, to death Plato knew from close experience just what the cave dwellers might do to those who claim to know the sun The solution, Plato says, is a process of widespread carefully administered philosophical education By which he understood the method of inquiry pioneered by Socrates and known to us as the \"Socratic Method\" It's a very gentle process. You don't lecture or harang or force someone to read a particular book You just start with a general declaration of intellectual modesty no one knows very much It's always good to insist: \"wisdom starts with owning up to ignorance\" Confess that you don't know exactly what the government should do, what wars meant to achieve or how good relationships work You then get the other person to say what they think and gradually together you investigate the answers Most likely the other person will be confident or rather painfully overconfident They may tell you it's all quite simple really and everyone knows the answer already You must be supremely patient with this kind of bravado If they go off topic, you must cheerfully double back You must take a lot of time and be ready to have chats over many days This method of talking is founded on a lovely confidence that with the right encouragement people can eventually work out things for themselves and detect errors in their own reasoning If you carefully and quietly draw their attention to tricky points and don't cast blame or ever get annoyed You'll never teach anyone anything by making them feel stupid Even if they are, at first We have all started in that cave but it is Plato's deepest insight that we don't have to stay there And the road out is called, quite simply, philosophy This is the sun whose light we can follow and by whose rays the proper nature of things can become clear If you enjoyed the films on this channel, you might want to hear about another smart insightful channel we love called Wisecrack Click here to visit their channel page and discover a succession of videos on world literature, philosophy, cinema, history and more All delivered with a playful beguiling sense of humor They're in L.A., we're here in London, but the School of Life and Wisecrack have become firm friends Based around shared values about making education compelling We'd love you to befriend us both in turn."

    "Title": "Self Sabotage",
    "Transcript": "It's normal to expect that we're always going to, almost by nature, actively seek out our own happiness. Especially in two big areas of potential satisfaction: relationships and careers. So it's odd and not a little unnerving to discover just how often some of us appear to act as if we were, deliberately, out to ruin our chances of getting what we are, on the surface convinced, that we're really after When going on dates with candidates we like the sound of, we may suddenly lapse into unnecessary opinionated or antagonistic behaviour. \"Hello.\" \"Hi, Ellen, what're you doing friday night?\" \"Yes?\" \"Yes?\" \"Who is this?\" \"Why, it's Bill, Bill Jenkins.\" \"Narrator: So Bill didn't do very well.\" When we have no difficulty being charming with the type we aren't so keen on, Or, in relationships, we may drive our partners to distraction through repeated, unwarranted accusations or angry explosions. As if we were somehow willing to bring on the sad day when, exhausted and frustrated, our loved ones would be forced to walk away. Still sympathetic, but unable to take so much drama. And similarly, we could destroy our chances of promotion at work when, out of the blue, after lots of promising years we get strident with our managers or, on several occasions, fail to hand in really important reports in time for meetings. Such behavior can't be explained away as mere bad luck. It deserves a stronger, more intentional term. This is self-sabotage. What could possibly explain such destructiveness? In large part, how plain ennerving happiness can sometimes feel to us. Though happiness is, of course, what we all fundamentally want, for many of us, it isn't really what we know. We grew up in and learned to make our peace with far darker scenarios. The prospect of hapiness when it in the end appears can, therefore, seem a bit counter intuitive and not a little bit frightening. It isn't what we've come to expect. And it doesn't feel like home. We may prefer to choose what's comfortingly familiar, even if it's difficult, over what is alienatingly fulfilling or good. Getting what we want can feel unbearably risky. It puts us at the mercy of fate. We open ourselves up to hope and subsequent possibility of loss. Self-sabotage may leave us sad but at least safely, blessedly, in control. It can be useful to keep the concept of self sabotage in mind when interpreting our and others odder behaviour. We should start to get suspicious when we catch ourselves pulling off erratic perfomances around people we deep down really like or need to impress. Furthermore, faced with certain kinds of viciousness and unreliability in others, we should dare to imagine the things are perhaps not quite as they seem. We might have on our hands not a nasty, malevolent opponent, but an almost touchingly wounded self saboter, who chiefly deserves a little patience and should gently be coaxed out of doing themselves further harm. We should come to terms with and help others to see just how hard and unnerving it can sometimes be to get close to some of the things we truly want.

    "Title": "Why We Look down on Low Wage Earners",
    "Transcript": "We're not necessarily involved in this kind of judgment ourselves, but we recognize the phenomenon in our society well enough. The more someone earns, the more likely to be admired by strangers and perceived as interesting and exciting. Respect appears all too often to be directly awarded, according to earnings. And in a related move, if you don't have much economic endorsement, it can be hard for your character or views to be taken seriously. It's not a mystery that this relationship got established. because there are so many conspicuous cases where we find a genuine link between talent, effort, skill, contribution, and income. The most impressive examples involves brilliant surgeons, the authors of Matilda and Harry Potter, or the team behind the development of graphene. All these geniuses had a lot of talent, they made a lot of money, and their contributions are terrific. They make the connections between a high income and virtue seem right and natural. But, turn to the pages of economics textbooks, and a very different, far less emotive account of wages emerges. Economics states that : wages are determined, not by social contribution, but by the number of people able and willing to do a given job, that others want done. If there are a lots of people able to complete the task, you won't need to offer very much money to get their labor. And if there are very few people able to do the job, you'll have to pay a lot more. But note that there's no room to judge the worth of the work being done. The determinant of wages is just the strength of demand in relation to supply. Taken in one direction, this explains the high salary of a hit man. A person who can, for the most exacting and difficult missions, where the target possesses private guards and is protected by triple glazed security glass, extract an early seven-figure sum $1,500,000. Simply because almost no one on earth is capable of carrying out such a complex maneuver. Taken in the other direction, the same theory of wages, explains the salary of the modern hospice nurse. Charged with accompanying people through their last days, a task as meaningful as one could imagine, yet whose yearly salary is a tiny fraction of the murderer's stipend. In neither case do the wages have any connection to the contributions being made. It simply has to do with how many people are capable of carrying out a task, and how much demand there is for it. It so happens that in our society, some really wonderful qualities, like consideration, sympathy, and hard work, are actually rather widespread, which has a deeply paradoxical consequence. You can employ someone with astonishing qualities and get away with offering them pretty much nothing at all. The whole economic system can seem entirely lacking in justice. And our minds rebel against the gross violation of the principles of fairness. It's normal if we should then scan the horizon in the hope of finding some answers that can lessen the pain. In the history of the West, there have been two huge intellectual attempts to resolve the impression of injustice around wages. The first is: Christianity, a doctrine which has insisted that a person's worth is to be determined in an entirely different sense to the financial. After death, a person's soul will be weighed by God, and his or her true merits perfectly rewarded for eternity. Wages can't change here on earth, but the meaning of the wage will in the eyes of Christianity be altered, and the humiliation of poverty should hence lose some of it's bitter sting. The other huge attempt to introduce justice was Marxism. Karl Marx's work argued for a new world in which workers would, for the the first time, be rewarded according to the worth of their contributions to society. So down would go; the wages of the hit men, casino owners, and mining tycoons. And up would go the wages of the nurse, and the farmer. Communism would return justice to incomes. In their own day, these seemed like very impressive solutions. Yet for different reasons, they're not in any way things we can now put our hopes on. The current economic order is pretty firmly established, and is not about to change any time soon. But the hopes remain for some way of dealing with the disjuncture between wages and contribution. It may be an odd place to look, but the most immediately usable solution to the situation may lie in a really unexpected place; the walls of an upper gallery in the Wallace Collection in London's Manchester Square - home to a small painting called, The Lace Maker, by a little-known German artist called Casper Netscher, who painted it in 1664. We've caught the Lace Maker in what looks like a quiet mid-afternoon. She's concentrating on a difficult task, carefully threading her needle. It would take her around five hours just to make one square centimeter. Her eye's will tire, she'll make something dazzling and moving, an externalization of the best sides of her nature. And yet, her reward for the exquisite craftsmanship will be a few pennies at best. Lace making was a major industry for women in the 17th and 18th centuries. But as it happens, it was also one of the lowest paid, for a stubborn unbudgable (immovable) reason we're coming now to understand. Lots of people could do this work. Interestingly, many artists were drawn to paint lace makers at their task. The artists had no hopes of reforming how lace makers got paid, but they had an ambition to change the lives of lace makers nevertheless. They wanted to use art to alter the status of these lace makers. By directing viewers to the intelligence and dignity of the craft of lace making, they hoped to redeem the social standing of this economically slighted class. What the artist were doing with lace makers reflects a general capacity of art, to redraw what we think as prestigious and to return proper appreciation for what certain people, especially those deemed marginal by the dominant social hierarchy, are and do. Sadly, for all the status we accord it, art is actually a pretty small thing in the world. But the move that art has made, needs to, and can be redeployed on a much larger scale. Art is a mechanism for appreciation, which is particularly adept at the close study of the ways in which an individual might be deserving of tenderness, sympathy and admiration; and yet neglected by the wider world. The goal of art is to increase the amount of dense and accurate information about people's jobs, so that we can stop using mere wages as our measuring rods. Once we get to know people well, in art or otherwise, the state of their bank balance invariably declines a little. And what they're really bringing to their tasks, starts to emerge, along with a fairer way of distributing honor and respect."

All human affairs are rehearsals of the same themes played out against a mildly changing background but merely articulating the essential futility of existence and the damn nature of humankind. Trapped like a fly in the bottle of life. We bring you a tree which today moved lightly in the breeze. There is so much to be grateful for. We should note that in some cases wisdom did prevail. Certain potential murderers did not, today, pick up a knife. Certain sorts of rage were defused for now. Some would-be adulterers had second thoughts Certain would-be suicide bombers saw into the eyes of a child and could not do it. We are no better than the beasts and the earthworms the lugs and the anthropods This individual here puts us to shame. In any case, the most important things have happened today have not occurred out there in the plains of Anatolia or the straits of Singapore or the corridors of the Pentagon but in your own soul, that vast, unexplored region itself no more studded than the dark side of a far-off planet in some distant galaxy.

    "Transcript": "transference is one of the most important and intriguing Concepts in Psychology it refers to the unconscious redirection of feelings from a person in one's past to another in the present knowing about the word in its meaning is a key to trying to become a slightly more mature and less dangerous person to be around at the heart of the theory of transference is the idea that our expectations of what other people are like is to an overwhelming extent dictated by what the people in our immediate vicinity were like in our childhoods especially our parents these formative figures determine a whole range of our behaviors our sense of for example how people might respond to our weaknesses whether those in Authority are benign or humiliating whether setbacks can be met with Panic or resilience whether others can be depended upon and so on in other words we don't enter adulthood like a blank slate waiting until all the data is in before we judge a situation and draw our conclusions strictly on the evidence in front of us instead we have powerful but hidden Tendencies to prejudge according to patterns laid down by our personal histories some of this pre-judgment might be sensible but a lot of it can be very Troublesome we may get more panicked than is warranted we may be so suspicious we don't give others a fair hearing we may be so sure we're about to be attacked we strike account preemptively we may be so nervous we fail the key thing about transference is that we can't generally tell it's happening we assume we're entirely reacting to the present when in fact our feelings are drawing energy from a source from long ago that's why maturity deeply depends on getting to know one's Tendencies to transference to help us in the task psychologists have devised a number of tests to tease out these transferences one exercise involves asking someone to finish sentence stops very quickly without giving too much thought thereby allowing the unconscious to reveal itself for [Music] example another classic transference exercise is the rash test devised in the 1930s by the psychologist Herman rash by being shown an ambiguous image and asked to say what it was roses believed that we would naturally reveal some of our latent guiding fears hopes prejudices and assumptions the important point in any rash test is that the image has no one true meaning different people merely see different things in it according to what their past predisposes them to imagine to one individual with a rather kindly and forgiving conscience this image could be seen as a sweet mask with eyes floppy ears a covering for the mouth and wide flaps extending from the cheeks another more traumatized by say a domineering father might see it as a powerful figure viewed from below with sped feet thick legs heavy shoulders and the head bent forward as if poised for attack the goal of maturity in general and Psychotherapy in particular is to help you to get on top of your transferences that means seeing the ways in which our views of Authority or sexuality or uncertainty have been distorted the idea is ultimately to be released from the past's indiscriminate hold on the present and to reduce the scope of our personal histories to determine our futures once we overcome our transferences we can be free to respond more reliably to the world as it is rather than how it was if you like our films take a look at our shop the schoolof life.com sshop you'll find lots of thoughtful books games stationary and more"

    "Title": "Confidence",
    "Transcript": "What often distinguishes fulfilled from unfulfilled lives is an ingredient that's not part of the educational curriculum, and that can sound vague, silly, and Californian in the bad sense. Confidence It's humbling to realize just how many great achievements haven't been the result of superior talent or technical know-how, merely that strange buoyancy of the soul that we call confidence. Why is confidence so easy to lack? Partly, it's a hangover from the past. For thousands of years, for most of us, there simply were no opportunities for hope: we were serfs and slaves, and the central psychological survival skill was to keep our heads down and our expectations low. Each of us still carries a little of the legacy from that past, an attitude of inner serfdom that threatens our spirit deep into a democratic, technological, modern age. Hope can feel dangerous. There might, in addition, have been parents who sent out subtle messages: \"People like us don't.\" \"Who do you take yourself for?\" We should feel compassionate about where those defensive parental messages came from; they were a protection, a survival strategy, and an escape from humiliation. School didn't necessarily help either; it wanted us to be good boys and girls, and taught us to trust in established authority. But we may, naively, have gone on too long, putting too much faith in existing institutions, and now suffer from doing whatever is asked of us a little too obediently. Part of becoming an adult seems to be to embrace the painful realization that grown-ups don't actually have the answers, and therefore, that we have every right, indeed a duty, to break certain rules and think things through independently. We need to learn a calculated form of disrespect, which can be a surprising thing after twenty years or so of enforced obedience. We need to learn a constructive suspicion of authority: a path between total compliance on the one hand, and sullen skepticism on the other. In addition, confidence seems to involve a courage to accept imperfection. It's tempting never to get going when everything has to be perfect, but that's a recipe for remaining under the bed, and yet, how often so-called \"great lives\" have been riddled with errors, that nevertheless, didn't sink them. Confidence begins with a capacity to forgive oneself the horrors of the first go. Death is a necessary thought too. We should use it not to further sadden us, but to scare us, fruitfully, into taking some action. Our fear of messing up should give way to the only real danger there is: that of never trying."

    "Transcript": "One of our deepest longings is for safety. We search for it through money, exercise, a good diet, a sound reputation, insurance, seat belts, love. And yet we remain always horribly vulnerable. A tiny blood clot and we're gone. A small slip and our reputations destroyed. A moment of inattention on the road and we're dead. A few temptations and relationships shatter. We remain subject to a constant array of random accidents. Meteorites far above and malignant cells deep within We don't have enough information to make wise choices over a lifetime. We can hold back the chaos for a while but entropy, erosion and destruction will win out in the end. The calm of a sunny morning, the money you're saving the house you feel you own the friendships you lay claim to the relationship you think is beyond question none of these promise lasting safety. We are all always desperately vulnerable. Our grasp on life, therefore, needs to be loose, grateful, and ready for the worst. Our imaginations no strangers to the full range of scenarios. We should also have a small, dark space in our minds where we acknowledge just how perilous everything we are and do really is. We should, in this space, be solemn and awestruck by the dangers we're up against. And, when we can manage it, before the small, everyday apocalypses that do all of us in eventually we should struggle to be kind and cheerful.

    "Title": "The Sex-Starved Relationship",
    "Transcript": "being in a relationship where it doesn't feel like there's enough sex sounds like a trivial and somewhat comedic luxury problem as though someone were complaining there wasn't enough tennis or yoga between a couple but an absence of sex isn't trivial in the least it's a humblingly serious problem and might even be what Dooms the relationship itself one statistic stands out in an average year in the oecd country's 70 percent of those who initiated divorce cited a lack of sex as the first or second reason for parting if there's one generalization we can make about couples it's that a lack of sex by which we mean something like less than four times a month is an alarm Bell we should listen to why is sex such a key part of keeping two people close because in sex two people accept each other in the most profound of ways the Apparently dirty and shameful sides of us the Wayward fantasies and the unusual longings are legitimated through sex someone else Witnesses and accepts us as bodily and psychological beings sex symbolizes an end to loneliness and a reaffirmation of trust not daring or wanting to have sex with a partner is tant about to admitting that one can't be oneself in their presence a lack of sex is bad enough but far worse is the way in which the unreciprocated longing for sex tends to manifest itself typically the person who wants it doesn't ask very clearly may be merely sliding a hand over in a timid half-hearted search for reciprocation they don't complain calmly don't deliver an eloquent self-confidence speech about how difficult they're finding it and don't inquire sympathetically as to what might be going on in the partner far too often they tend to quickly move on to symptomatic Behavior wherein their disappointment and sense of humiliation are acted out rather than discussed they bang dishes they get mean a whole raft of conflicts then develops that has ostensibly nothing to do with sex and yet is caused by its absence one starts squabbling over the In-laws in the state of the kitchen the one who's been let down sexually behaves so badly they start to seem like a monster further reducing the chances of sex ever taking place eventually the sex-starved party May simply go off and have an affair not because they don't love their partner but because showing their desire has become so fraught with rejection that they're out for a bit of Revenge the lack of sex discussion is so hard to have because quite simply It Feels So shameful to be unwanted sexually it plays into every worst fear about unacceptability it's bad enough when it happens on a date it's even sadder to have to admit that once being rejected by one's partner inside the apparent safety and commitment of a long-term relationship maybe there's something wrong with them but far more likely there's some revolting about us key to a process of reconciliation is to reign in one's Wilder feelings of rejection and self-disgust in order to be able to consider why the other party might have gone off sex here's a key fact everyone wants sex in principle when it isn't wanted it's because a condition for sex is not being met and then not communicated privately the sex rejecting party has a problem they're not sharing they might in secret be thinking I might have sex if only you listened more to my problems with my family or if you gave me more time to do my work or if you weren't so mean to me around domestic Jaws there might be kinkier reasons I'd have more sex if you allowed me to play out certain fantasies if you were more broad-minded about role-playing if you were more into kissing or wanted it rough or could be more submissive the person being denied sex hasn't usually had any chance to hear these reasons in plain unaccusing gentle terms or maybe they've heard them but without a sober awareness of what's really at stake here there's been no proper communication therefore a classic recommendation deliberately artificial is that the two parties aware that their entire relationship probably depends on getting this right should write each other a letter titled simply what I want from sex it's a chance to be deeply honest about your true sexual identity it's then incumbent on both parties to take the other's words seriously and in good faith two people are always going to be a bit sexually incompatible but we shouldn't get so scared and angry at this that we create a secondary barrier of hurt punishment and shame we should take the first steps to finding a way in which what you want and what they want can in a modest way be harmonized and the sarcasm bang dishes can stop every time such a conversation about sex happens in the quiet of the night the angels of relationships hover over the bedroom and sound their silent trumpets in celebration because another couple have just critically improved their chances of lasting a little longer together if you like

    "Title": "PHILOSOPHY: Immanuel Kant",
    "Transcript": "Immanuel Kant is a philosopher who tried to work out how human beings could be good and kind outside of the exaltations and blandishments of traditional religions. He was born in 1724, in the Baltic city of Königsberg, which at that time was part of Prussia and now belongs to Russia, renamed Kaliningrad. Kant's parents were very modest, his father was a saddle maker Kant never had much money, a fact he dealt with cheerfully by living very modestly. It wasn't until he was in his fifties that he became a fully salaried professor and attained a moderate degree of prosperity. His family were deeply religious and very strict. Later in life Kant did not have any conventional religious beliefs, but he was acutely aware of just how much religion had contributed to his parents' ability to cope with all the hardships of their existence and how useful religion could be in fostering social cohesion and community. Kant was physically very slight, frail, and anything but good looking, yet he was very sociable and some of his colleagues used to criticize him for going to too many parties. When eventually he was able to entertain, he had rules about conversation at his table. At the start of a dinner party he decreed that people should swap stories about what had been happening recently, then there should be a major phase of reflective discourse in which those present attempted to clarify an important topic, and finally there should be a closing period of hilarity so that everyone left in a good mood. He died in 1804 in his eightieth year in Königsberg, having rarely felt the need to spend any time outside the city in which he was born. Kant was writing at a highly interesting period in history we now know as The Enlightenment. In an essay called \"What is Enlightenment?\" published in 1784, Kant proposed that the identifying feature of his age was its growing secularism. Intellectually, Kant welcomed the declining belief in Christianity, but in a practical sense he was also alarmed by it. He was a pessimist about human character and believed that we are by nature intensely prone to corruption. It was this awareness that led him to formulate what would be his life's project, the desire to replace religious authority with the authority of reason, that is human intelligence. When it came to religion, Kant summed up his views in a book entitled \"Religion within the bounds of reason alone\". Here he argued that although historical religions had all been wrong in the content of what they believed, they had latched onto a great need to promote ethical behavior, a need which still remained. It was in this context that Kant came up with the idea for which he's perhaps still most famous, what he called the \"Categorical Imperative\". This strange sounding term first appeared in a horrendously named work \"Groundwork of the metaphysics of morals\". The Categorical Imperative states: What did Kant mean by this this? This was only a very formal restatement of an idea that's been around for a long time, something we meet within all the main religions: Kant was offering a handy way of testing the morality of an action by imagining how it would be if it were generally practiced and you were the victim of it. It might be tempting to filter a few pads of paper from the station recovered at work, it seems like a small thing. But if everyone did this, the cupboard and society at large would need a lot of guards. Similarly, if you have an affair and keep it quiet from your partner you might feel that's okay but the categorical imperative comes down against this because you would then have to embrace the idea that it would be equally okay for your partner to have affairs and not tell you. The categorical imperative is designed to shift our perspective, to get us to see our own behavior in less immediately personal terms and thereby recognize some of its limitations. Kant went on to argue that the core idea of the categorical imperative could be stated in another way: This was intended as a replacement for the Christian injunction for universal love, the command to \"love one's neighbor.\" To treat a person as an end, for Kant meant keeping in view that they had a life of their own in which they were seeking happiness and fulfillment and deserve justice and fair treatment. The categorical imperative, Kant argued, is the voice of our own rational selves. It's what we all truly believe when we're thinking sensibly, it's the rule our own intelligence gives us. Kant extended his thinking about the categorical imperative into the political sphere. He believed that the central duty of government is to ensure liberty, but he sensed there was something terribly wrong with the ordinary definition of freedom or liberty, it should not be thought of in libertarian terms as the ability to do just whatever we want. We are free only when we act in accordance with our own best natures, and we are slaves whenever we are under the rule of our own passions or those of others. As Kant put it, So freedom isn't an absence of government, a free society isn't one that allows people more and more opportunity to do whatever they happen to fancy. It's one that helps everyone become more reasonable. The good state represents the rational element in us all. It rules according to a universally valid will under which everyone can be free, so government ideally is the externalized, institutionalized version of the best parts of ourselves. It might be a bit surprising at first to discover that in 1793, Kant published a major work on beauty and art, \"The Critique of Judgment.\" It might seem like a bit of a sideline for a thinker otherwise concerned with politics and ethics, but Kant held that his ideas about art and beauty were the cornerstones of his entire philosophy As we've been seeing, Kant thought that life involved a constant struggle between our better selves and our passions, between duty and pleasure. Beauty, Kant especially liked roses, vines, apple trees and birds, delights us in a very special and important way. It's a reminder of and goad to our better selves, unlike so much else in our lives, our love of beauty is in Kant's word \"disinterested,\" it takes us out of our narrow, selfish concerns but in a charming delightful way without being stern or demanding. The beauty of nature is a continual, quiet, and insistent reminder of our common universal being. A pretty flower is just as attractive to the tired farm worker as to the prince. The graceful flight of a swallow is as lovely to a child as to the most learned professor. For Kant, the role of art is to embody the most important ethical ideas It's a natural extension of philosophy. Kant held that we needed to have art continually before us, so as to benefit from vivid illustrations and memorable symbols of good behavior and thereby keep the wayward parts of ourselves in check Kant's books were dense, abstract, and highly intellectual, but in them he sketched a very important project that remains crucial to this day. He wanted to understand how the better, more reasonable parts of our natures could be strengthened so as to reliably win out over our inbuilt weaknesses and selfishness. As Kant saw it, he was engaged in the task of developing a secular, rational version of what religions had, very imperfectly, always attempted to do, help us to be good"

    "Title": "How to be an Entrepreneur",
    "Transcript": "Many of us want to become entrepreneurs. Starting your own business is one of the biggest dreams of our times. But how do you get to be an entrepreneur? Most of the advice focuses on the practicalities: writing a business plan, raising money, finding staff, marketing and PR. We'll go down a different route. In our eyes at the heart of successful entrepreneurship lies something oddly more abstract: an accurate insight into the causes of human unhappiness. To be an entrepreneur means, essentially, to become an expert in the things that make life difficult for people. That's because every properly ambitious business is in some way trying to fix things for other people. And the bigger and more original what you're trying to fix happens to be, the more successful your business can be. Because consumer society is now well developed, it may be easy to think that all the big problems out there already have thousands of fixes anyway. Think of all those car companies, or pizza outlets, or news websites. We surely have enough of everything. What could we possibly add to what's already out there? But to get a sense of the vast opportunities that still remain in capitalism all you need to do is ask yourself: where and in what areas you're unhappy in the course of an average day? Every unhappiness is really a new business waiting to be born. Your frustrations are a nearly inexhaustible source of raw materials out of which the businesses of the future can be built. So while there may already be plenty of breakfast cereals, and t-shirts, and cell phones, and cab rides for sale, there's so much more that frustrates and depresses us: think of how difficult it is to get on with one's partner, educate children, cope with anxiety, discover what you want to do with your life, find a nice place to live, calm down in the evening. One could go on and on. Our griefs and irritations are endless, thankfully for the budding entrepreneurs. The biggest first step to take towards entrepreneurship is therefore to learn to study your own unhappiness and what might possibly heal it for you and others. When profits decline in businesses it's really the result of too many people throwing themselves at trying to fix the same area 'cause they can't think of anything more innovative to do rather than start a new airline, mobile phone company, or supermarket chain. And by contrast, healthy profits are a reward for understanding and mastering an area of human distress ahead of anyone else. Of course ideas aren't enough on their own; you need to take care of practicalities and money but they won't help you if your original psychological insight into human unhappiness isn't sound. And by the same token, if your insight into what makes people unhappy is razor sharp, and your solutions bold, then however difficult the journey, your business will stand a high chance of making money and benefiting humanity too."

    "Title": "HISTORY OF IDEAS - The Renaissance",
    "Transcript": "The phenomenon known as the Renaissance is one of the standard stops on any tour through the history of Western culture. It encompasses a roughly 300 year period in Europe, where architects, poets and philosophers reconnected with the style and ambitions of ancient Greek and Roman civilization. The reasons for studying the Renaissance nowadays are often left a bit unclear. To the high-minded and respectful the rationale may seem utterly obvious, or to the more impatient or technologically focused the exercise can equally will appear a complete waste of time. We believe that the main reason to study history is to rescue certain good, provocative and inspiring ideas that have been lost in the past, in order to put them to use in relation to the dilemmas and problems of our own times. Our tour of the Renaissance while seemingly about some old long dead guys will hence really be about us. Florence, Italy, 1469 A 20 year-old nobleman from one of the grandest families of Florence, Lorenzo de' Medici takes over the family business: The Medici Bank, that's been going since 1397 and is the most respected financial institution in Europe with flourishing branches in Florence, Venice, Rome and Geneva. Lorenzo like his uncles and his father before him has a great gift for business. During his lifetime, the bank will open new outposts in Basel, Bruges, Avignon, Pisa, and lend significant sums of money to royal courts, aristocrats and entrepreneurs. Lorenzo and his family are typical of the Florentine upper classes of his age in honoring the business of making money without any of the traditional suspicion of trade found in most Christian societies. But not only are Medicies interested in making money they are also extremely ambitious about how to spend money. They believe that the express purpose of what we would now call philanthropy is to promote beauty, truth and wisdom in the world. Lorenzo de Medici's grandfather had started the collection of books that became known as The Medici Library and Lorenzo now expanded it decisively with his researchers scouring Europe's monasteries, courts and libraries for lost or overlooked text from antiquity. Lorenzo was a patron of many philosophers including Marsilio Ficino, Poliziano and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. Under his guidance, these philosophers undertook pioneering researches into Greek philosophy. They absorb the ideas of Epicurus, Cicero and Aristotle and try to harmonize Plato's theories with Christianity. Lorenzo is perhaps best known as a patron of art. His court artists included Verrocchio, Leonardo, Botticelli, Ghirlandaio and Michelangelo. The patronage was extremely intimate and involved. Michelangelo lived with Lorenzo and his family for five years, dining at his table and participating in discussions led by Marsilio Ficino. Although the Medici were quite rich by modern standards, their fortune was a relatively moderate one. Across four crucial decades, from the 1430s to the 1470s, it's estimated that the Medici family spent the equivalent of around half a billion US dollars on intellectual patronage, architecture and art works, which is a huge sum by comparison with average incomes but it's not very substantial by comparison with the wealth of the richest people today. The Medici family resources would be roughly those of Rosa Cafferata whose wealth from a fishery business in Peru is around 1.5 billion US dollars. She is at present 1200th richest person in the world. Lorenzo would seem economically unimpressive next to Giorgio Armani, 8.5 billion, and a nonentity next Bill Gates, 79 billion. Money was important to what Lorenzo and his family achieved no doubt. So in that respect the world is amazingly well placed to continue in his footsteps. There's no shortage of money to do the sorts of things he did. But what's holding us back today is a shortage of vision. For the price of this yacht, Lorenzo fueled the Renaissance for 30 years. The secret to the Medici's impact was that they didn't see themselves as there simply to hand over the cash to allow artists, architects and scholars to do whatever they wanted. The Medicies had a vision, a mission for the arts and for philosophy, and we're extremely direct and didactic and putting it forward usefully so. Guided by his philosopher friend Ficino, Lorenzo thought of art the kind of education. Under his patronage, artists were therefore asked to illustrate key philosophical truths about say the importance of kindness and compassion. They promoted serenity and glorified the best qualities of the state and of good leadership. The Renaissance would never be remembered if its leading members that simply made piles of cash. No one cares about that for any length of time. The real source of its glory was the imagination and intelligence with which its great bankers and finances set about spending their money. Monastery of Fulda, Germany, January 1417 An Italian scholar and humanist, Poggio Bracciolini is on a tour of Germany and Switzerland, looking for lost Greek and Roman manuscripts. He is spending a few weeks in a Benedictine Monastery, hunting around the dusty shelves of its great library, when in a forgotten nook, he makes one of the great discoveries of the whole Renaissance. He comes across what still remains the only surviving manuscripts Lucretius, de Rerum Natura, On The Nature of Things which gives us the most complete account we possess of the philosophy and worldview of the Greek philosopher Epicurus. Bracciolini and his circle are astonished. Epicurus has hugely valuable ideas about the human passions, happiness, religion, communal life and science. This is only the highlight of a career spent rescuing lost manuscripts. In time, Bracciolini is to go on to discover key text by Cicero, Quintillion  and Vitruvius. When he couldn't by text, he wasn't averse to a little skulduggery to get what he wanted. He famously bribed a monk to abstract a copy of Livy, the Roman historian from the library of Hersfeld Abbey in Germany. Bracciolini was hugely interested in classical texts but he was not a scholar as we would understand the term, that is someone who wants to investigate the past for its own sake and respects the inherent nobilty of old books. The Renaissance attitude to history and philosophy was very different. Its intellectual leaders took a relentlessly practical view of things. They wanted first and foremost to run their societies successfully, to make their people wise and to build magnificent cities. The Epicurean philosophy Bracciolini dog up with its emphasis on friendship, simplicity and the acceptance of limitations wasn't exciting to him because it was old, but because its wisdom was still needed. He wasn't looking for ancient idea so he could fill in missing details about how the past used to be perhaps in order to gain a professorship in a university, Bracciolini was urgently searching for help in creating better ways of thinking for the present. Central Florence, 1484 Michelozzo di Bartolomeo one of Cosimo de Medici favorite architects completes the family home: The Palazzo Medici, just near the city's new cathedral. Michelozzo has studied Roman antiquities closely and the building's tripartite elevation beautifully expresses the characteristic Renaissance spirit of rationality, order and harmony. This is a golden age of construction in Florence. Leon Battista Alberti has done the facade of the Church of Santa Maria Novella, Brunelleschi has put up the Spedale degli Innocenti and the city's new cathedral dome and many less well-known names of completing squares, fountains and thoroughfares. The same is true for the other great Renaissance cities of Siena, Venice, Urbino, Mantua and Rome. City fathers across the Italian peninsula have fallen in love with a remarkable new idea: that their cities should be the focus of an unparalleled attention to beauty. It's slightly embarrassing to contrast these efforts with our own mess. A sentimental view says that the Renaissance city fathers made nice places because they were lucky: They didn't need to plan for cars, they didn't have the zoning laws and happen to have access to good quality building materials like lovely stone you can get from quarries outside Florence. However, successful urbanism is never an accident. For the Renaissance, it was a philosophical mission. The Renaissance built such great cities because of an idea: that we are to a large extent shaped by the character of the buildings around us. Making sure that the public realm conveys dignity and calm is more than a luxury. It can help to ensure the sanity, vigor and happiness of a whole population. What's more, the urbanists and architects believed in rules. They didn't think it was chance that a city looks good. They wrote volumes codifying what works and what must be avoided, in their efforts to systematize and in their careful thinking about what makes a good street corner, pavement or bench. They put our own efforts and urbanism to shame. They believed in ideal dimensions for squares, that a square should be small enough that a mother can call from an upper window to her child playing at the other side. They thought that all good squares should have large elaborate fountains in the middle, but that the surrounding buildings should mostly be fairly plain. They knew that building should be around five storeys in height and there should be graceful covered arcades, so that citizens could amble in all kinds of weather. Renaissance leaders like the Medici were marked by the views of the ancient Roman historian Sallust who had been deeply hostile to a situation that are developed in the decadent periods of Rome, where they had been in his words \"Publice egestas privatim opulentia\", public squalor and private opulence. Sallust believed and the Renaissance leaders hugely embraced his idea that in a healthy society the public sphere itself should be opulent that is beautiful refined and appealing. That way the richer people in society will never be tempted to withdraw and concentrate exclusively on their own private estates and comforts and all citizens will be uplifted by pleasing vision of communal life. It's a tribute to these efforts that there are still very few cities on earth nicer than those created over a few hundred years on the Italian peninsula. But it's also testimony to our desperate lack of ambition and vision that we can count on one hand the number of cities constructed since the Renaissance that are prettier than say Florence or Venice. Ideally, we wouldn't have to be so impressed by Renaissance cities. We'd be inspired to arrival and equal their achievements in the architectural idiom of our own times. Frari Church, Venice, 1488 A 58 year old Venetian painter, Giovanni Bellini completes a triptych, featuring in the central panel baby Jesus and his mother. Christian artists have been painting this scene for many centuries but things have only become this powerful in convincing in the last hundred or so years. Hitherto, Mary and her little boy have looked stiff often gone and wooden, but with Bellini, Jesus is just like a real little boy. A kind we might see looking at seagulls on the Lido, down to his stocky legs slightly swollen tummy and searching eyes. Marry feels equally alive, vibrant and deeply attractive and interesting. we can imagine her melancholy thoughts, and Intuit her kind sympathetic and dignified nature. If there was some childcare available, you might be lovely to invite her out to the gelateria Grom  just a few steps away from the Frari Church. It's often been remarked how odd and wondrous it is that so many geniuses of art came to the fore in such a short period in one place. Renaissance Italy gave world civilization Donatello, Frangelico, Whichello, Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, Leonardo,  Michelangelo, Raphael, Titan and so on. How did it happen? how do you get so much talent in one go? It's arguable that every age has roughly similar amounts of latent talent among its artists. What makes certain ages extraordinary, one thinks of the Golden Age of Athens, Holland, 19th century France or 1960s America is that they know what to do with the talent. They give artist a mission. They have a clear sense of what art is for, and they therefore reward and invest in artist properly. What distinguishes the Renaissance is not therefor a freakish preponderance of artistic skill. It's an intensely clear vision of what art should be. The Renaissance could be described as a heroic age of advertising. Yet the focus was not on selling consumer goods. It was on selling beauty, truth and wisdom. The energy we still feel behind their art arose from a coherent ideological program. The Renaissance wanted to put painting in the service of ideas and to make these ideas palpable, effective and life changing. One thing the Renaissance was constantly advertising is philosophy. Philosophers were in the minds of many, then as now rather abstract and remote figures. So the Renaissance got one of its most talented artists, Rafael to lend them a bit of life on the walls of the Vatican, to shows Aristotle and Plato and others as belonging to a group of glamorous, fascinating individuals. For his part, Titian was employed to convey a central philosophical message  about the brevity of life. In his Three Ages of Man, existence is depicted as desperately fleeting. The child is soon an adult and the adult soon ages and in retrospect, it all seems to have occurred incredibly fast, which makes it essential that we use our time properly, that we forgive one another for our frailties, and focus on our potential while there is still time. Titian and his patrons knew that most people don't care to think about how brief life is. That's where art comes in and has a huge advantage over philosophy. Titian starts with things that everyone in the Renaissance already liked: sexy couples and cute baby angels. The picture is designed to take you without you even noticing it's happening into an interest in hilosophy so that you naturally start to engage with matters of life and death. The move is a bit like that made by the best adverts of today that hope to get you subliminally interested in buying a chocolate bar or an SUV while charming you with a beautiful couple or sublime landscape. Only in the Renaissance the philosophical end goal of art was worth the effort. The Renaissance concept of art as advertising for the great truths was underpinned by an ideology worked out by the philosopher Marsilio Ficino. The figure who taught by Renzo de Medici and spoke to Michelangelo at dinner every day for many years. Ficino argued that we are all creatures who love and love is attracted first to beauty, so whatever we wish people to love we must first make beautiful and beauty is first encountered as sexiness. So the path to the highest possible human ideals tends to go down a complex root: first to sex, then to beauty and then to love. With such a theory to hand and its impact on the art of the Renaissance cannot be overestimated. Ficino was able to use what we might term sexiness, lust, glamour and celebrity to serve the most noble and high-minded intellectual ambitions rather than being relegated as they often are in our own times to selling handbags or mobile phones. Never before or since have so many big ideas been so beautifully and often sexually treated by great artists. Ficino and lorenzo de medici was fascinated by the idea of getting Botticelli to engage our sexuality in order to excite us about ideas that they thought were most useful to humanity. That's why there are an awful lot of very cute people in Botticelli's work. The hugely alluring figures in his Primavera are for example thoughtful, kind and serious and sometimes rather sad. They're filled with tenderness towards human sorrows and failings and a keen to remind us of the need to appreciate the cycle of life. They're also highly seductive. You don't have to believe in the virtues to want to be like them. But because you instinctively want to be like them, you will therefore aspire to be virtuous. This genius move shared by philosophers like Ficino rich political leaders like Lorenzo and artists like Botticelli was to line up our basic desire on the side of the good. So that we become a kinder and sweeter and more intellectually ambitious not because we've rejected all the charms of the world which hardly anyone ever can but with the help of all the charms of the world. Instead of abandoning beauty and sexiness to vanity and silliness, the leaders of the Renaissance, deeply scholarly and earnest people, cease these and use them to their own ends. It's this move above all that helps to give the art of the Renaissance its mission-driven coherence and means the artist still so charming to us today. In our society the Renaissance has a lot of prestige. We think we're being true to it by going around its main cities, memorizing dates and taking off key works but this isn't really what paying tribute to the renaissance should mean. It's not about looking at their world through our eyes it's about using their eyes to look at our world. We should be trying to generate a Renaissance in our own societies with the help of these geniuses. Learning lessons from them about how to spend big money perhaps earned in finance wisely, how to use the humanities to improve our lives rather than to impress a scholarly community, how to devote proper energy to creating livable beautiful cities and how to harness the power of art so is to make the good things in the world attractive and desirable. If rather than being just dutifull tourist we learn to absorb the ambitions of our nation's leaders we might come away from a study of the Renaissance ready as all the great Renaissance figures would have wanted us to be to do the thing that really matters, try to change our world for the better."

    "Transcript": "Is it better this way, or that way? It's horrible whichever way. It's not very respectable, really to feel frustrated with one's appearance. Mature and reasonable people are not supposed to go around regretting the shape of their nose or the way their hair falls. Yet, you gaze in the bathroom mirror and think: Why? In my brief existence on this planet does this have to be me? For those unhappy with their looks pictures are painful each new image brings more bad news yet, this isn't crazy. We care about our looks for a sound reason: Because everyone judges us by them Because they determine the first response To deal with the challenges of our appearance we need to develop a particular kind of wisdom Here is a start to learning how to cope with one's looks Personal appearance simply is one of the least democratic parts of life It's a lottery and you haven't won. It's nothing to do with you, nor is it to their credit that it is them. It just is. A bold man would appreciate your hair like no one else will. It's the ugly who are at the best place to appreciate beauty. Something the beautiful should bear in mind when they're considering on who bestow their favors. People learn about love from their parents. And when they're grown up, often search for lovers who remind them a little in some subconscious way of mum or dad. The good news is that often mum or dad were quite weird or ugly looking. That helps to explain the odd choices good looking people sometimes make. Thank god for ugly parents. The world is dominated by an often unfair money hierarchy Against that, it's refreshing that there's also this strange looks hierarchy. It doesn't restore justice, but it thumbs its nose up at other forms of injustice just a little. However unfair the distribution of appearance is today, time will eventually bring justice. No one ends up happy with how they look. It's just a question of waiting. For some, this enchantment may start at 10. For others, it may take another 40 years. But it will happen, for sure. Rather then saying appearance doesn't matter you can get better at noticing the less obvious but still real beauty in odder places. The trouble with our culture isn't so much that we love appearances but that we focus on too narrow range of features and qualities So, start to get interested in someone's august forehead Note the melancholy sweetness of their eyes Admire an expression of kindly acceptance Point out serenity A trusting face A candid nose There are so many good and attractive things we can see in people's faces If we're alert to different types of beauty. And hopefully, someone, somewhere, will one day do the same for us."

    "Transcript": "This is going to be a very bad film. It will teach you nothing. You'll wonder at the end where those few minutes of your life have gone. You'll feel bitter, resentful, and increasingly furious. Now, that's a tiny example of what pessimism can do for you. It prepares you for the worst, reduces the tension of expectations, protects you from disappointment, and might even make you laugh a bit. It should be a recipe for life. We live in an absurdly and painfully optimistic world. Mostly, that's the result of all the businesses out there trying to sell us things. And, understandably, using cheerfulness to do it. And partly, it's the influence of technology, which is always getting better, coloring our view of life as a whole, which often, isn't improving. In the process, we've lost sight of the wisdom of seeing the glass half empty. For centuries, religions peddled dark messages. Buddhism told its followers that life was suffering. Christianity spoke of the fallen state of mankind and of the inevitability of earthly imperfection. It was helpful: it kept our expectations in check. The psychologist, William James, came up with an equation: Happiness equals expectations over reality. So, there are two ways to ensure contentment. Change reality, or, change expectations. Pessimists know to reduce the expectations. Good pessimists rehearse some key lessons to themselves every day: Life generally goes wrong. Everyone is worried and sad most of the time. It's normal to have very big regrets around careers. The only people we can think of as \"normal\" are people we don't yet know very well. It's hard to be happy for more than fifteen minutes. Almost all your hopes are going to be dashed. Mediocrity is the norm. Today, however grim, will probably be one of those days you end up looking back on and wondering why you didn't appreciate more fully. That's how much worse it will eventually get. Don't think of us pessimists as grim; the gap between what should be and what is can be filled with laughter, a generous laughter, but one of certainty that today will go wrong, tomorrow will probably be even worse, until the worst of all happens. But that's okay."

Build up isolated frustrations into giant interconnected narratives of persecution. Become very sensitive to noise, then move to a city where a lot of people are taking advantage of rising property prices to redo their homes. Start to notice fingerprints on walls, chipped plates, and towels on bathroom floors; see these as personal insults. Be sure not to get enough sleep, but never attribute your moods to tiredness. Expect children to be grateful. Compare your relationship to the happiest couple that the media is choosing to tell us about at the moment. Attribute most issues in your life to the mendacity and shortsightedness of your partner, and their family. Avoid perspective. Never look at NASA images of distant galaxies. Find a YouTube channel or news outlet that you are almost certain to dislike. Watch some videos and read articles, and feel very irritated by the presentation of views you strongly disagree with. Never watch others getting angry; fail to see how absurd they can seem. Develop a faith that fury is in some ways quite impressive, macho, and makes stuff happen.

    "Transcript": "almost every developed nation boasts of having a rather unusual institution at its center a state broadcaster these state broadcasters receive taxpayers money on the basis that they serve the public interest in a way that commercial broadcasters never can in exchange for our cash they frequently broadcast shows about ancient history and documentaries about endangered species the concept behind such institutions sounds plausible but in truth there's terrible confusion about what they should really be doing and in the process society squander a lot of opportunities to increase their well-being in relation to the many and appalling problems they face modern governments have some traditional levers they can pull to try and adjust behaviors most obviously they have the law they also have the tax system health policy and school and university curricula in relation to some challenges government levers work extremely well but in relation to others the results are patchy at best there's one crucial area where they hardly seem to work at all a large arguably even the largest share of the issues undermining advanced nations are what one could call psychological at their root that is they have to do with our minds without deeper patterns of thinking and feeling these problems include family breakdown domestic violence poor parenting alcoholism drug addiction obesity depression chronic anxiety delinquency and loneliness taken together these tennis shoes cost national governments and overwhelming share of their annual national budgets currently there's no easy way for governments to address these problems at best they try and tinker with the odd public ghoulish advertising campaign try to add on a class about this or that on to the school curriculum play around with a tax system give advice to social services trial a bit of subsidized psychotherapy print leaflets about parenting and hope for the best but the results tend to be very poor because better relationships aren't really fostered by a change in the tax law few people ever read leaflets there's not much money for public service ad can pains and it's naive at best to imagine that you can address large-scale social issues by tacking on some talks to 16 year-olds in schools on Friday afternoons in order to stand any chance of addressing national psychological ills you have to get into people's minds on a huge scale with charm and skill at regular repeated intervals this is where the tantalizing opportunity lies just within reach of most governments available for no extra money stands the most powerful lever imaginable the state broadcaster broadcasting truly works it's the single most effective way of changing mentalities a million times more helpful than a book leaflet or class revolutionaries have always known that it's why they always drive the tanks to the TV station first currently state broadcasters are aware that they should be making programs that foster the public good but they're desperately vague about what the public good really constitutes it often seems to them bound up with broadcasting shows about the high arts but very few nations are actually undermined because not enough of the population know about lettre viata and vogner's Ring cycle governments should redefine what the public good actually means they know what it is because they have via their statistical offices incontrovertible evidence about what the public bad is their statisticians constantly tell them the figures on obesity drug addiction and broken families public broadcaster's should therefore be charged with a simple mission annually orientating all their output to addressing the ten leading social problems statistically undermining their Nations this threatens the sound horribly worthy wall-to-wall programs about obesity and family breakdown surely no one would watch one imagines excruciating ly tedious shows by egghead psychotherapists but that's precisely not what the mission would be the challenge wouldn't be just to make unpopular programs about important things but to make the good popular this is what taxpayers money would really be paying for to foster the genius required to curry compelling mass entertainment the very best comedies dramas game shows and documentaries about the most important things to date this has only been done sporadically the challenge would be to generate this material institutionally properly done state broadcasting would dramatically start to change the mood of the nation what one had seen on TV

    "Title": "Why Comedy Matters",
    "Transcript": "[laughter] [more laughter] We think comedy is just about a relaxing laugh, but the job of a comic is, in fact, deeply serious and important to the mental well being and flourishing of a society. In the olden days, they were called \"jesters,\" officially licensed and salaried comics, whose explicit job it was to make jokes for the king as a way of drawing them back to the things that really mattered, and saving them from errors of pomposity. This suggests that comedy might be a requirement-- a bit like having your teeth checked, or doing the accounts-- not some optional extra when you feel like watching a bit of TV. There are a host of things that comedy helps us with. For a start, it's a medicine against despair. A lot of humor picks up on the darkest things in our lives-- death, anxiety, failure-- but rather than reconciling us to them, it helps us to feel cockily defiant and strong about them. Consider Velazquez's rendition of the dying Christ. Then turn to Monty Python's comedic take on the same situation. --Crucifixion, mm? Good. Out of the door, lying on the left, one cross each. A comic attitude doesn't deny misery, but it has a very different relationship with it. --Ah man, I shot Marvin in the face. Comedy can be infused with a mood of defiance. One's gonna laugh at rather than buckle in front of the miseries of existence. In Monty Python's \"The Life of Brian,\" the closing song brazenly states the worst of our existence. The mood is mocking; there is a refusal to be gloomy. In 1940, when Britain was in a very precarious military situation, a song mocking the Nazi leaders became wildly popular. The enemy's power was all too terrifyingly apparent; the point was simply to keep them cheerful, and defiant was centrally important to the task of just keeping them going. By mocking dangerous things, humor can embolden us; it paints what's potentially very frightening as helpfully ridiculous. Comedy is also a great remedy for a sense of humiliation. Life is filled with things which deeply threaten our dignity. We're never far from being reduced to complete mockery. In the children's television series, \"Peppa Pig,\" a father, Daddy Pig, is always doing things that could be seen as absurd, humiliating, or embarrassing. In the opening sequence, he makes a loud, rather obnoxious grunt. He's overweight; he can come across as lazy. It would be extremely easy to make a very negative assessment of his character. That's the kind of thing we tend to do for ourselves and other people: we regularly rehearse the case for the prosecution. In cartoons, though, this very flawed creature is presented as somehow both flawed and extremely lovable. His wife and children are deeply attached to him. They do see him as a bit of an idiot; it's just that they love him as he is. In their eyes, he is a lovable fool. That's what a lot of comedy helps us with: it turns people, ourselves included-- people who could just be seen as idiots in normal life-- into those far more valuable characters: lovable fools. If we happen to walk down a road and saw a man called Basil Fawlty bashing his car with a branch of a tree, we'd feel he was just some awful, furious bloke venting his anger in a crazed, destructive way. We'd judge him a thoroughly unpleasant fool. Fortunately, for Basil Fawlty, he's not in real life, but in a comedy by John Cleese and therefore, he isn't just an idiot. He's that classic comedic character: a lovable fool. His vices are introduced alongside some deeply ingratiating qualities. The show teaches us to really like someone whom in real life, we might have cursed. It's a remarkable achievement on the part of the comedy team, akin to what Jesus did when he got us to think lovably about criminals and low-lives. Comedy produces benevolent stereotypes. If someone says, \"You're a bit of a Woody Allen,\" it's a benign alternative to saying, \"You're a deeply annoying over intellectual worrier.\" --You-u-u're like New York Jewish, left-wing liberal intellectual, Central Park West, Brandeis University uh, socialist summer camps and uh-h the father with the Ben Shahn drawings, right? Woody Allen's taught us to look more kindly on the foibles of people we'd otherwise risk calling neurotic wimps. It's the reverse of bad stereotyping, in which we make a problem worse by emphasizing how deeply awful certain people are. Comic characters always hold on to our sympathy. --ACHOO! To say that a work colleague is a bit of a David Brent isn't merely to point out that they're tactless and insecure-- it's also to re-frame those failings. Because we come to feel tender towards David Brent as well as laughing at him, we see his vulnerability, not just his idiocy. We get good at recognizing that it's his anxiety about not being like or respected that leads him to do all those deeply embarrassing things. Larry David is always getting angry and abusive. He's incredibly combative and rude. He gets into huge arguments all the time. And yet, he's sort of charming. --What's not to like? So, once again, with the help of comedy, we're re-framing an otherwise tempting but wholly negative stereotype: grumpy old man. The comic move is to guide us to a benevolent conception of people, and hence, parts of ourselves. Comedy also does a great job at reducing power imbalances. It's hugely reassuring to see the powerful laughing at themselves. Finding oneself comical is a token of maturity; it means being able to see one's faults without being too defensive about it. Humor often provides a mechanism where by the powerless, or at least, the less powerful, can give constructive but pointed feedback to the powerful. Monty Python was particularly focused on this task. \"The Philosophers' Football Match\" mocks the great figures of intellectual history. It's funny because we've been intimidated so deeply in the past by intellectual bullies, we made us feel small with our reading of Wittgenstein or Schopenhauer. And now they're shown as being completely rubbish at football, and yet seriously involved in the game. Comedy isn't just a bit of fun. The comic perspective is a central need of a society. It enables us to cope much better with our own follies and disappointments, our troubles around work and love, and our difficulties enduring ourselves. Comedy is waiting to be re-framed as a central tool in a better society."

    "Title": "PHILOSOPHY - René Descartes",
    "Transcript": "René Descartes was a French 17th century philosopher, famous above all for saying 'I think therefore I am', but worthy of our attention for many reasons beyond this. What makes him stand out is that he was a fierce rationalist. In an age when many philosophers still backed up their arguments with appeals to God, Descartes trusted in nothing more than the human power of logic. This is how he defiantly kicked off his book 'Rules for the Direction of the Mind': 'I shall bring to light the true riches of our souls, opening up to each of us the means whereby we confined within ourselves, without any help from anyone else, all the knowledge that we may need for the conduct of life.' Descartes had immense faith in what introspection guided by definition, sound argument, and clarity of thought could achieve. He believed that much of what was wrong with the world was caused by misusing our minds by confusion, bad definition, and unconscious illogicality. His life was an attempt to make our minds better equipped for the task of thinking. To solve key questions, Descartes proposed that one always had to divide large problems into small, understandable sections by way of incisive questions. This is what he called his 'method of doubts'. We get muddled by certain questions like 'what's the meaning of life', or 'what is love?', because we're not careful enough about how we break these big inquiries down. He described the method of doubts as akin to having a large barrel of apples where good ones are mixed with bad ones. To be a philosopher means a commitment to sorting out the entire barrel to inspecting each apple Individually and throwing away all the bad ones to ensure only those of the best quality are left. Another way to think about Descartes, and this explains why he would among other things, turn out to be such a hero to the leaders of the French revolution, is that he believed in grounding all of our ideas in individual experience and reason, rather than authority and tradition. In his greatest book 'Discourse on the Method' published in 1637, he explained how he had come to write it: 'A long time ago, I entirely abandoned the study of letters resolving to seek no knowledge, other than that which could be found in myself or else in the great book of the world, I spent my youth traveling visiting courts and armies, mixing with people of diverse temperaments and ranks gathering various experiences, testing myself in situations which fortune afforded me, and at all times reflecting personally upon whatever came my way so as to derive some profit from it.' Descartes spent a large part of his adult life away from his native France in the Dutch Republic, since he held the belief, not entirely unwisely, that the mercantile Dutch would, as a people, be far too concerned with earning money to pester a free-thinking man like himself. However it turned out that the Dutch were a little less materialistic than he'd hoped, and the philosopher ended up moving 24 times to keep ahead of spies and government agents. Descartes' subjective approach to philosophy reached its climax when he arrived at the famous phrase 'Cogito ergo sum' —'I think therefore I am'. The phrase first appeared in French—'Je pense donc je suis'—in the Discourse on the Method before then appearing in Latin in the Principles of Philosophy of 1644. It was intended to be Descartes' ultimate answer to a question that philosophers sometimes get perhaps unreasonably interested in, namely 'How can one know that anything including oneself, actually exists rather than being some sort of dream or phantasm?' On his quest was certainty around this question of whether it might all be a dream Descartes began by observing that our human senses are deeply unreliable. He couldn't, for example, he said, be trusted to know whether he was actually sitting in a room in his dressing gown next to a fire, or merely dreaming of such a thing. But there was one thing he could know for sure: he could trust that he was actually thinking. His existence could be proved by a neat tautological trick. He could not be thinking and wondering if he existed if he did not exist, therefore his thinking was a very basic proof of his being or to return to the maxim 'I think therefore I am'. This might not sound like a huge insight, but Descartes used it as an Archimedean point in an epistemologically unsteady world. With this certainty safely banked, Descartes argued that his mind could go to discover other similarly irrefutable truths. Some of the charm of Descartes' work comes through his entwining of personal details, along with more arid philosophical passages. He tells us, for example, that his revolutionary idea came to him during the winter of 1619, when he'd escaped the fierce cold of the low countries by hopping into a stove and spending the whole day meditating inside. Descartes epitomizes the solitary end of philosophy. One can, in his eyes, solve the most profound problems by searching deep within oneself. Teams of individuals, or ideas passed through the generations as they are in universities are deeply suspect for Descartes. Philosophers don't need gangs of scientists using expensive equipment, unheard-of terminology and huge datasets. They just need a quiet room and a rational mind. At another point, Descartes recounts that he mocked friends of his who once showed up at his home at 11 in the morning and was surprised to find him still in bed. 'What are you doing?' they inquired skeptically. 'Thinking,' Descartes replied. The group was stunned, but Descartes criticized them in turn for privileging often nonsensical practical tasks over the beauty of pure quiet reflection in bed. In 1649, Descartes finished another great work: 'Passions of the Soul'. It was the outcome of six years of correspondence with a royal acquaintance, the Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia, who was a keen amateur philosopher, and a rather emotional and turbulent soul. She had written to Descartes begging him to write about passions in order that she might get to know and control her own more clearly. Descartes obliged. Thinking that the ancient philosophers had done a poor job of analyzing the passions and that ordinary and not-so-ordinary people would benefit immensely from another look at the topic, he therefore opened the Passions of the Soul with a characteristic claim: 'I shall be obliged to write just as if I were considering a topic that no one had dealt with before me.' The word provides a beautiful taxonomy of pretty much any passion one might feel, as well as descriptions of their causes, effects, and functions. This is followed by another section called 'The Discipline of Virtue', a manual of advice on how we can control our passions and enjoy a virtuous life. Descartes identified six fundamental passions: wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy, and sadness. From these they're followed in his eyes an unlimited number of specific passions; combinations of the original ones. Descartes didn't believe in vanquishing passions as the ancient stoic philosophers had proposed, merely in learning how to identify them in oneself and understand their impact on one's behavior. He would have been very sympathetic to psychotherapy. He believed that a key task of being a philosopher was to help people understand and therefore control their passions; that is, become a little less anxious, status-driven, scared, or inclined to fall head over heels in love with inappropriate people. He was optimistic about how much progress we could make psychologically. Even those who have the weakest souls can acquire absolute mastery over their passions if they work hard enough at training and guiding them. Descartes' psychological and philosophical work attracted ever more powerful admirers. In 1646, Queen Christina of Sweden got interested in sorting out issues in her mind and began a correspondence with Descartes. She even persuaded the philosopher to move to Sweden to tutor her in passion and philosophy in 1649. However, the early working hour was required. the queen could only make time for lessons at 5:00 a.m., and the harsh cold soon made Descartes ill. He died of pneumonia in 1650 at the age of 53. To remember Descartes by 'I think therefore I am' is perhaps not as shallow as one might initially have presumed. The sentence does truly capture something important about him and the task of philosophy in general. It signals a commitment to working through emotional confusion, prejudice, and unhelpful tradition, in order to arrive at an independent rationally founded vision of existence."

    "Transcript": "We all say we want to be with someone nice; it sounds so plausible. -Did I tell you about this date last night? -What happened? It was, I mean, the worst! You think they're not going to get any worse, but then they do! Just doesn't make sense, I mean, you're clever, you're pretty, you're funny; why can't you find the right man? -Thank you! -Yeah Well, all I'm looking for, I don't think it's too much to ask, is someone who's, you know kind, funny, nice, and normal But in practice it's pretty hard to deal with niceness when it does come along. So I didn't run; it's so embarrassing! Would you like to go out for a drink sometime? -Yeah, okay! -Yeah, like, I could call you about 9 o'clock after work? -Yeah! Cool! -Brilliant! A tiny part of us might think \"If they're any good, why are they interested in us?\" I had the most amazing time last night. Thank you I love the color of your hair. If we aren't totally convinced of our own lovability, another person's affections could be a bit unnerving. \"Wouldn't they rather be with someone else? Is something wrong with them?\" Their niceness can be so unsettling you might even try a trick or two. Oh, hi! It's, it's me. It's Hannah? People who treat us like shit can seem like they understand something profound about life and about us. Yeah, no, I'm, uh, I'm just at the office at the moment, yeah. Thought I'd call, see what you were doing, if you wanted to hang out. Uh, next week, sort of, time is good. I'll call you. Uh, or yeah, no, uh, you-you call me, an-or we'll figure it out. Their assessment of us is more align with our assessment of ourselves. We shouldn't hold it against nice people if they like us. Maybe they see something in us we've overlooked. But you, the nice ones, shouldn't be naive either. It's very frightening to have to deal with niceness. It can be unfamiliar. It can freak some of us out. So be ready for us to panic and hang on in there."

    "Title": "On Feeling Melancholy",
    "Transcript": "Melancholy isn't exactly a word on everybody's lips. But we should pay more attention to it, even seek it out from time to time. Melancholy is a species of sadness that arises when we are open to the fact that life is inherently difficult and that suffering disappointment are core parts of universal experience. It's not a disorder that needs to be cured. Modern society tends to emphasize buoyancy and cheerfulness but we have to admit that reality is, for the most part, about grief and loss. The good life is not one immune to sadness but one in which suffering contributes to our development. Melancholy is an underused word. It doesn't mean grim and miserable. It means grasping without rage the fact that the world is full of folly and greed that it is rare to find inner peace, that it is hard to live comfortably with those we love, that it's very unusual to have a career that's both financially rewarding and morally uplifting, that many decent people have a very hard time. Often sadness simply makes a lot of sense. We learn so late about stuff. You've wasted years; everyone has. You can only avoid regret by switching off your imagination. The wisdom of the melancholy attitude as opposed to the bitter, angry one, lies in the understanding that the sorrow isn't just about you, that you have not been singled out, that you're suffering belongs to humanity in general. To take that fully to heart is to become more compassionate and less vengeful. The melancholy facts shouldn't make us desperate, rather, more forgiving, kinder, and better able to focus on what really matters while there is still time."

    "Title": "Meritocracy",
    "Transcript": "Politicians from all walks of life nowadays agree on one thing:  we need to build more meritocratic societies. That is, societies where everyone, no matter what their background is, has the chance to succeed on their own merits. This is a beautiful idea responsible for some great things like free education for all, positive discrimination, and a real effort to end nepotism in business and government. We've largely done away with the old world of feudalism where lords couldn't manage their estates, commanders couldn't understand the principles of battle, and peasants were brighter than their masters. No longer is background an impossible obstacle to advancement. An element of justice has finally entered into the distribution of rewards. It's been going on for about two hundred and fifty years, ever since Napoleon declared that the ranks of the French army and civil service would henceforth be open to all on merit rather than family background. It's been a brilliant development but there is, importantly, a darker side to the idea of meritocracy. Because if we truly believe that we've created or could one day create a world where the successful truly merited all their success, it necessarily follows that we'd have to argue that the failures were exclusively responsible for their failure. In a meritocratic age an element of justice enters into the distribution of wealth and status, of course, but also of poverty. Low status comes to seem not just regrettable, but also deserved. Succeeding financially, without inheritance or contacts in an economic meritocracy, gives individuals an element of personal validation that the nobleman of old, who'd been given his money and his castle by his father, had never been able to feel. But at the same time, financial failure has become associated with a sense of shame that the peasant of old, denied all chances in life, had also thankfully been spared. The question of why, if one's in any way good, clever, or able, one is still poor becomes infinitely more acute and painful for the unsuccessful to have to answer, to themselves and other people, in a new meritocratic age. This turned out to be no shortage of people willing to answer the question on behalf of the poor. For a certain constituency it's clear, and perhaps even scientifically provable, that the poor owe their position to their own stupidity and degeneracy. With the rise of an economic meritocracy in certain quarters, the poor have moved from being described as unfortunate, the target of the charity and guilt of the paternally minded rich, to being described as failures, fair targets of contempt in the eyes of robust, self-made individuals who are disinclined to feel ashamed about their mansions or shed crocodile tears for those whose company they've escaped. In the harsher climate of opinion that can gestate in the fertile corners of meritocratic societies, it's become possible to argue that the social hierarchy rigorously reflects the qualities of the members on every rung of the ladder and so that conditions already in place for good people to succeed and the dummies to flounder, attenuating the need for charity, welfare, redistributive measures, or simple compassion. It's a symptom of our great faith in meritocracy that it's largely become impossible to explain away our failures as the result of bad luck. While it's granted that luck maintains a theoretical role in shaping the course of our careers, the evaluation of people precedes in practical terms as if they could all fairly be held responsible for what happens to them. It would seem duly and even suspiciously modest to ascribe a victory to good luck and more importantly, it would be pitiable to blame defeat just on bad luck. Winners make their own luck. That's what modern society tells us. It's tough living in a world so in love with the idea that we're all responsible for everything that it's largely dismissed bad luck as a credible explanation for defeat. But, of course, there can never be a truly meritocratic system because the merit of an individual is far too complex and subtle a thing to be determined by what job you end up having and how much money you end up earning. Those who have faith in meritocracy are essentially subscribing to an insane and certainly arrogant assumption that ordinary humans -- employers or customers -- can handily take over the solemn responsibilities that past ages more wisely left in the hands of a god who, helped along by the angels, was due to weigh the souls of each person on the day of judgement. No one in this world ever gets exactly what they deserve in terms both of the good things and the bad things. Life, is to a large extent we don't quite admit to, random in a way that the meritocratic philosophy denies. To free ourselves from some of the more punishing side effects of a meritocratic world view it would be wise to cease investing something as haphazardly distributed as jobs and money with moral connotations and we should retain a little of the old-fashioned, modest belief in a distinction between what some earns and what they're like as humans."

    "Title": "POLITICAL THEORY – Jean-Jacques Rousseau",
    "Transcript": "Modern life is deeply attracted to the idea of progress in the 18th century as European societies became ever richer and more technological, the conventional view was that mankind was firmly set on a positive trajectory from savagery and ignorance toward prosperity and civilization. But there was at least one eighteen century philosopher who violently disagreed and who continues to have very provocative things to say to our own era. Jean-Jacques Rousseau was born to an educated watchmaker in Geneva in 1712. when he was 10 his father got into a legal dispute and the family was forced to flee Geneva. From that point on Rousseau's life was marked by deep instability and isolation. As a young man who went to Paris and there was exposed to the opulence and luxury that was the order of the day in the Ancien Régime Paris. It was a far cry from his birthplace of Geneva a city that was sober and deeply opposed to luxury goods. Then one day in 1749 he read a copy of a newspaper, The Mercure de France that contained an advert for an essay on the subject of whether recent advances in arts and sciences have contributed to what was called the \"purification of morals\" in other words was the world getting better? Rousseau experienced something of an epiphany. It struck him that civilization and progress had not in fact improved people. Instead they'd exacted a terrible destructive influence on the morality of human beings who had once been good. Rousseau took this insight and turned it into the central thesis of what became his celebrated discourse on the Arts and Sciences. His argument was simple: Individuals had once been good and happy but as people had emerged from their pre social state and join society they had become plagued by vice and sin. In this work and its twin, The Discourse on the Origins and Foundations of Inequality, Rousseau went on to sketch what it would have been like at the beginning of history, an idyllic period that he called \"the state of nature.\" A long time ago when men and women lived in forests and had never entered a shop or read a newspa per the philosopher pictured people more easily understanding their own minds and so being drawn toward essential features of a satisfied life, a love of a family, respect for nature, an awe at the beauty of the universe, curiosity about others and a taste for music and simple entertainments. The \"state of nature\" was moral and guided by spontaneous pity, empathy for others and their suffering. So what was it about civilization that Rousseau thought had corrupted people and led to moral degeneracy. Rousseau claimed that the march toward civilization had awakened in people and unhealthy form of self-love, amour-propre, he called it, something that was artificial and centered around pride, jealousy, and vanity. Rousseau argued that this destructive form of self love had emerged as people had moved into cities and there had begun to compare themselves to others and created their identities solely by reference to their neighbors. Civilized people had stopped thinking about what they wanted and they felt and merely imitated other people, entering into ruinous competitions for status and money and losing sight of their own sensations. Rousseau is forever associated with a term \"noble savage\" because it was his work that describe the innocence and morality of our ancestors and contrasted it with modern decadence. At the time Rousseau was writing, European Society was fascinated by the plight the native North American tribes. Reports of Indian society drawn up in the 16th century had once described the Indians as materially simple but psychologically very rich and interesting. Communities with small, close-knit, egalitariam, religious, playful, and martial. However within a few decades of the arrival of the Europeans the status system of Indian society have been revolutionized through contact with a technology and luxury of European industry. Indians now longed for guns alcohol, beads, and mirrors Rates of suicide and alcoholism had risen, communities were fracturing, and factions were squabbling. The modern world had ruined the lives of people who'd once lived happily in the \"state of nature.\" Rousseau's interest in natural goodness made him very interested in the idea, though not quite the reality, of children. In 1762 he wrote Émile, or On Education, perhaps the most successful book ever written about how to raise children. Rousseau suggested that children were born naturally good and that the key to raising them was therefore always to prevent their corruption by society. This idea was widely influential. Parents who had before this time seen their children as wicked or at best as blank slates now viewed them as founts of wisdom and tried to give them a childhood full of play and visits to forests and lakes. Rousseau became the inventor of child-centered education. He was also a great proponent of breastfeeding, declaring \"Let mothers deign to nurse their children, morals will reform themselves, nature's sentiments will be awakened in every heart and the state will be repeopled.\" It was, he knew, a bit of hyperbole but its spurred a wave of breastfeeding even among the wealthy who had long disdained the practice. Artists rushed to paint and honor the new vogue for breastfeeding. Because Rousseau so closely valued human beings in their original state, it followed that in the novels he wrote, Rousseau also constantly celebrated intense feelings rather than great deeds or social events. In his novel, Julie, written in 1761, Roussseau depicted the excitement and anguish of an upper-class women caught in a love triangle between her sensitive tutor and her boring but socially sanctioned aristocratic match. Rousseau's contemporaries might have seen Julie as unwise and her feelings as a passing fancy, but Rousseau painted her love in a higher light. He urged us to see its grandeur, depth and honor. In his writings about his own life, Rousseau was similarly romantic or, what one might unkindly call, self-absorbed. In his famous Confessions, one of the first ever autobiographies, Rousseau spend pages exploring his inner life: How frustrating he found shopping, the surprising feeling of tenderness for his ex's new partner, or the joys of gardening.To him, these weren't trivial or self-absorbed topics, they were part of an important task: to show is like on the inside. \"I have conceived of a new genre of service to render to man,\" he boasted, \"to offer them the faithful image of one amongst them in order for them to learn to know themselves. Rousseau died in 1778 age 66. His reputation has continued to grow. He was from beyond the grave one of the heroes of the French Fevolution and he became an icon to a great many artists and writers of the 19th century. Rousseau can be considered as one of the founding figures of what we now know as the Romantic Movement, an ideology responsible for valuing the primitive over the civilized, the child over the adult< the passionate lover over the calmly loyal spouse. The modern world despite its addiction to status, machinery, and capitalist values, in many ways continues to be profoundly romantic in its heart. It's astonishing that so much of what we take to be common sense, or just natural, can directly be traced back to the work of one not always wise but always highly intriguing and provocative thinker."

    "Title": "POLITICAL THEORY - Thomas Hobbes",
    "Transcript": "Thomas Hobbes was a 17 century english philosopher who is on hand to guide us through one of the thorniest issues of politics: to what extent should we patiently obey rulers,especially those,who are not very good. And to what extent should we start revolutions and oppose governments, in search of a better world? Hobb's thinking is inseperable from one major event , that began when he was that began when he was 64 years old and was demarking him so deeply, it colored all his subsequent thinking remarkably, he died when he was 91 and so everything he remembered for today he wrote after the age of 60 this event was the english civil war a vicious,divisive, costly and murderous conflict that raged across england alomost a decade and pitted the forces of king against parliament leading to the deaths of 200,0000 people on both sides Hobbes was by nature a deeply peaceful and cautious man he hated violence of all kinds a disposition that he began at the age of 4 when his own father, a clergiman, was disgraced and abandoned his wife and family after he got inta a fight with another cleric(?) on the steps of his church in a village in Wilt Shire the work, for wich we remember Hobbes \"Leviathan\", was published in 1651 It is the most definitive persuasive and eloquent statement  ever produced as to why one should obey governmental authority even of a very imperfect kind in order to avoid the risk of chaos and bloodshed to understand the backround of Hobb's conservatism it helps to realise that across western europe in the 17th century political theorists were beginning to ask with a new directness, on what basis, subjects should obey their rulers? For centuries, way back into the middle ages that been a standed-on on such of this contained in a theory called: \"The divine right of kings\" This was a blunt, simple but highly affective theory stating, that it was non other than god who appointed all kings and that one should obey these rulers for one clear reason: because god said so and he would send you to hell if you didn't agree but this was no longer proving quite so persuasive to many tougthful people, who argued that the right to rule ulltimately lay not with kings but with ordinary people who gave kings power and therefore should only expect to take orders from kings so long as, but ONLY so long as things were working out quite well for them this was known as \"The social contract\" theory of government. Hobbes could see that \"The divine right of kings\" theory was nonsense and whatsmore was going to be increasingly unpersuasive as religious observants declined. He (Hobbes) himself was privately an atheist. at the same time, Hobbes was deeply scared of the possible consequenzes of \" The social contract\" theory wich could incourage people to oppose rulers, whenever they felt unhappy with their lot. Hobbes has received a first-hand account of the beheading of king Charles I. on a scaffold at the palace of whitewall (?) in 1649 and his intellectual labors were directed at making sure that such (nasty), primitive scenes would never be repeated So, in \"Leviathan\" Hobbes puts forward an ingenious argument that tries to marry up \"social contract theory\" with a defence of total obedience and submission to traditional authority. The way he did this was to take his reader's back in time to a period he called \"state of nature\". Before there were kings of any kind and to get them (readers) to think about how governments would have arisen in the first place... Key to Hobbes' arguement, was that the state of nature would not have been a nice place because humans left to their own devices without a central authority to keep them in awe would quickly have descended into a squatting, infighting and intolerable bickering It would have been a little like the english civil war but with people in bear skins bashing each other around with flint tools In Hobbes's famous formulation that life in the state of nature would have been \"nasty,,brutish and short\" As a result, out of fear and dread of chaos people will tend(?) to form governments they have done this willingly as social contract theorists maintain but also under considerable compulsion fleeing into the arms of strong authoritiy wich they therefore , Hobbes argued had a subsequent duty to keep obeying with only a few rights to complain, if they didn't like it. The only right, that people might have to protest about an absolute ruler or \"Leviathan\" as Hobbes called him if he directly threaten to kill them However, if a ruler merely stifles a position imposes enormous taxes cripples the economy or locks up people's willimilly this was absolutely no reason to gather on the streets and demand a change of government as Hobbes wrote: He admitted that a ruler might come along with \"an inclination to do wicked deeds\" But the people would STILL have a duty to obey this person, as: But this inconvenience is anyway the fault of the people not of the sovereign, because as Hobbes adds: \"If men could rule on their own, there would be no need for at all of a common coersive power As he went on: Hobbess's theory was dark, cautious and not especially hopeful about goverment. In our more optimistic moments, we want him to be wrong but it seems Hobbess's name will always be relevant and fresh again when revolutions, motivated by search for Liberty go horribly wrong.... Hobbes maintained in the preface to\"Leviathan\", that he had written the book:"

    "Title": "What is 'success'?",
    "Transcript": "In our societies we use the word \"success\" a lot and we think we know just what it means: money, status, fame, and power. But take a look in the dictionary and things start to look, thankfully, a lot more complicated. Because success is, in truth, rather more neutral and less value-laden then we tend to assume. It just means doing anything well,  excelling at something and that might encompass a lot of different activity: running 100 meters, for sure, selling your app for a lot of money, okay, but also stranger, less heralded things like: listening a lot, very attentively, to a child, or being extremely kind to strangers, or filling your mind with interesting ideas and associations, or knowing just when to put  an arm around someone when it's too much for them. People who triumph here are also big success stories. No one can be successful at everything, whatever they tell us, it's almost impossible to succeed with a career and a family, or with popularity and integrity, there are always sacrifices. It's great to be successful. It's even better to make sure you followed your own distinctive and, not necessarily, always obvious path to the success that can truly fulfill you."

    "Title": "Psychotherapy",
    "Transcript": "There is a lot that holds us back from trying out psychotherapy. There is the idea that you have to be a little mad or harbor some huge and strange problem to go and see a therapist. It can be hard to see that therapy isn't in fact for the select, disturbed few, it's for everyone. Because, actually it's entirely ordinary to be rather confused, a bit anxious, and sometimes challenged by relationships, family life, and the direction of your career. So really, the only qualification for going to therapy is to be a normal human being. There is also the worry about the strangeness of it all. It will be you and someone you've never met, to whom your expected to divulge nothing less than your inner life. Why not talk to a friend? Well, firstly, because friends aren't properly trained to listen. As one would have noticed, they interrupt, a lot. And secondly, because it's sometimes easier to tell someone who has no prior knowledge or expectations of you the big and important things about who you are. Furthermore, Therapist are the last people ever to judge. Their concept of a normal human being is far more expansive than that held by society at large. They know how unsual and surprising we are, especially around sex and anxiety. Their whole training takes them into the recesses of their own and others minds. They know how surprising we can all be. It doesn't frighten them - it intrigues and motivates them. That's why they became therapists in the first place. They are in the end, interested in mental health, that means, in helping out. Then there's the cost. Isn't it all a fortune? It might be the price of going out for dinner with friends, which is both a lot, and not so much. It really just depends on the value you place on it. This is the crux of it: Therapy is valuable, because so many of our problems come down to not having enough insight into how our minds work: What we want? What we fear? Why we act the way we do? and are overwhelmed by certain feelings? The goal of therapy is self-knowledge. By talking a lot to someone who listens very carefully, over many weeks you come to deeper insights into the mind you inhabit. Patterns start to emerge, a particular way of approaching relationships, or dealing with defeat, a recurrent, not very helpful, approach to jealousy, an ongoing thing with your sister or father - This is the stuff of therapy. Knowing how to live isn't an instinct, we are not born with it. It's a skill. And one of the places you learn it is in the outworldly, slightly unusual but in fact, deeply normal and productive setting of a therapist's office. It isn't a sign of disturbance to go to therapy it's the first sign of sanity and of a proper, grown-up commitment to mental health."

    "Title": "PHILOSOPHY - Hegel",
    "Transcript": "Georg Friedrich Hegel was born in Stuttgart in 1770. Intellectually he was adventurous, but in externals, respectable, conventional, and proud of it. He ascended the academic tree and reached the top most branch, head of the University of Berlin, when he was sixty years old; he died the following year. Hegel wrote some very long and very famous books, among them, \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\", \"The Science of Logic\", and \"Elements of the Philosophy of Right\"; but, we'll be frank: he wrote horribly; his work is confusing and complicated when it should be clear and direct. He tapped into a weakness of human nature: to be trustful of grave-sounding, incomprehensible prose. This has made philosophy much weaker in the world than it should be, and it's made it much harder for us to hear the valuable things that Hegel has to say to us, amongst which a small number of lessons stand out. Firstly, important part of ourselves can be found in history. In Hegel's day, a standard European Way of looking at the past was to consider it as primitive, and to feel proud of how much progress has been made to get us to the modern age. But in his book, \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\", published in 1807, Hegel argued that every era can be looked at as a repository of a particular kind of wisdom. This means we need to go back in time to rescue things which have gone missing. So, for example, we might need to mine history of ancient Greece to fully grasp the idea of what community can be, something which has been lost in the modern age. Or, the Middle Ages can teach us, as no other era can, about the role of honor, even if this period featured appalling attitudes to children or the rights of women. \"Progress is never linear\", Hegel tells us; \"there is wisdom at every stage\", \"which\", says Hegel \"points us to the task of the historian.\" \"To be a historian is to be someone who should rescue, from the past, those ideas that're most needed\" \"to compensate for the blind spots of the present.\" Secondly, learn from ideas you dislike. Hegel was a great believer in learning from one's intellectual enemies, from points of view we disagree with, or that feel alien. That's because he held, \"the bits of the truth are always getting scattered even in unappealing, or peculiar places,\" \"and we should dig them out by asking always, 'what sliver of sense and reason might be contained in otherwise frightening or foreign phenomena?'\". Nationalism, for instance, has had many terrible manifestations even in Hegel's day, but Hegel's move was to ask what underlying good idea or important need might be hiding within the bloody history of nationalism. He proposed that it's the need for people to feel proud of where they come from, to identify with something beyond merely their own achievements, and to anchor their identities beyond the ego. Hegel is a hero of the thought that really important ideas may be in the hands of people you regard, at first glance, as beneath contempt. Thirdly, Progress is Messy Hegel believed the world makes progress, but only by lurching from one extreme to another. As it seeks to overcompensate for a previous mistake. He proposed that it generally take three moves. Before the right balance on any issue can be found. A process that he named the DIALEKTIK. He was often thinking of the complex twist and turns that brought about the modern state. We can also think the slow path towards sensible attitudes to sex in our own time. The Victorians impose too much repression, yet the 1960s may have turn out to be too liberal. It might only be by 2020s that we`ll find the right balance between extremes. All this can seem the most appalling waste of time, but Hegel insists that the painful stepping from era to era is inevitable. Something we must expect and reconcile ourselves to when planning our lives or contemplating history books. And sometimes in this process of moving from era to era we`ll find a new solution, that manages to synthesize the good qualities of the previous solutions, to make something really new, and different and better. Four, Art has a purpose. Hegel vigorously rejected the idea of art for art sake. Painting, Music, Architecture, Literature and Design: all have a major job to do. We need them so that important insights can become powerful and helpful in our lives. Art is in Hegel`s formulation: \"the sensuous presentation of ideas\". Just knowing ideas often leaves us cold. for example in theory we believe the conflict in Syria is an important one. In practice however we just switch off. In principle we know we should be more forgiving to our partners, but this abstract conviction gets forgotten at the least provocation. The point of art Hegel realized, is not so much to come up with startling new strange ideas but to take the good, helpful, important thoughts we already think we know, and make them stick more imaginatively in our minds. Five. We need new institutions. Hegel took a very positive view of institutions and of the power then can wield. This is a point Hegel made again and again in different ways. For ideas to be active and effective in the world, a lot more is needed then the ideas are simply correct; to make major truths powerful in society they need employees and building and budgets and legal advices; institutions allow for the scale of time and power the big projects need to become effective in the world. So, as new needs of a society get recognized, they should ideally lead not just to new books but to the formation of new institutions. Nowadays we might say we need major new institutions to focus on relationships, consumer education, career choice, mood management and how to bring up less damaged children. Hegel help us to see valuable insights what we might initially resist them, in art in institutions in the ideas of our enemies and in the strange mistakes of the past. His insight is the growth requires that clash of divergent ideas and therefore that will be painful and slow. But at least once we know this we don`t have to compound our troubles by thinking them abnormal. Hegel gives us a more accurate and hence more manageable view of ourselves, our difficulties and where we are in history."

    "Title": "POLITICAL THEORY - Niccolò Machiavelli",
    "Transcript": "We're often appalled by how sly and dishonest many politicians are, but we shouldn't be. In moods like this we need to remember and read the works of Niccolo Machiavelli. A late 15th century political advisor and political theorist who argued that we shouldn't think that politicians are imoral and simply bad for lying and dissembling and maneuvering. A good politician, in Machiavelli's remarkable view, isn't one who's friendly and honest and kind. It's someone, however occasionally dark and underhand they might be, who knows how to defend, enrich and bring honor to the state, which is also an extremely important goal. Being nice may well be a virtue in general, but what citizens most need from their rulers is effectiveness, which may well call upon some darker arts. Once we understand this basic requirement, we stand to be less disappointed and clearer about what we want from our politicians. Niccolo Machiavelli was born in Florence in 1469. His father was a lawyer And so Machiavelli received an extensive formal education and got his first job as secretary for the city of florence But, soon after his appointment Florence exploded politically And expelled the Medici family who'd ruled it for 60 years And suffered decades of political instability and turmoil As a consequence, Machiavelli experienced a series of carrier reversals. Over just a few decades, he went from being an important diplomat to a semi-successful general, to an enemy of the state - tortured and then exiled when he Medici returned to power. Although Machiavelli was rather a failed politician,  he can be remembered as a truly great man because of the two works - THE PRINCE, and THE DISCOURSES. In them he addressed a central problem of politics: it is almost impossible to be both a good politician and a good person in a traditional christian sense. Machiavelli proposed that the overwhelming responsibility of a good prince is to defend the state from external and internal threats. To stable governance. This means, he must know how to fight but more importantly he must know about the reputation and the management of those around him. People should neither think he is soft and easy to disobey. Nor should they find him so cruel that he disgust his society. He should seem unapproachably strict ,but reasonable. When Machiavelli turned to the question of whether is was better for a Prince to be loved or feared? He wrote that while it 'll be theoretically wonderful for a leader to be both loved and obeyed. a Prince should always err on the side of inspiring terror. For this is ultimately what keeps people in check. Machiavelli christian contemporaries had suggested that princes should be merciful, peaceful, generous, and tolerant. They thought that being a good politician was. in short, the same as being a good christian. But Machiavelli argued differently. He asked his readers to dwell on the incompatibility between Christian ethics and good governance And particularly referred to the case of Girolamo Savonorola. Savonorola was a dominican friar , a fervent idealistic christian, who'd briefly come to be the ruler of Florence in 1494. He'd come to power promising the city of God on earth.He preached against the excesses and tyranny of Medici government. and even managed to rule Florence as a peaceful, democratic, and relatively honest state. However, Savonorola success couldn't last because,in Machiavelli's view, itwas based on the weakness that always attends being good in a christian sense. it was not long before his regime became threat to the corrupt Pope Alexander. whose henchman captured and tortured Savonarola. Hung him in the center of Florence and burnt the body before the eyes of a vengeful citizenry. This, in Machiavelli eyes, is what tends to happen to the nice guys in politics. Rather than follow this unfortunate christian example, Machiavelli suggested that a leader would do well to make judicious use of what the called virtu (VIRTUE). Machiavelli concept of virtu for politicians involves wisdom, strategy, strength, bravery, and when necessary, ruthlessness. In fact at one point Machiavelli uses the deliciously paradoxical phrase ' Criminal Virtue' to describe the necessary ability of leaders to be cruel in the name of the state , and yet, still good as leaders. Machiavelli provided some criteria for what constitutes the right occasion for bit of criminal virtue. Any violence must be strictly necessary for the security of the state. ; it must be done swiftly, often at night - counsel Machiavelli, and it should be repeated too often lest the reputation for mindless brutality builds up. Machiavelli gave the example of his contemporary, Cesare Borgia, Whom he admired as someone who knew how to be tough, but not too tough that we might question the criteria Machiavelli used. when Cesare conquered the city of Cesena, he ordered one of his mercenary, ramirida okow, to bring order to the region which ramiro did through swift and brutal ways - Men were beheaded in front of their wives and children; property was ceased; traitors were castrated. Cesare then turned onto okow himself and had him sliced in half and placed in public square. just to remind the town's people who the true boss was. but then, as Machiavelli approvingly noted, that was enough blood shed. Cesare moved on to cut taxes,imported cheap grain, build a theater, and organized a series of beautiful festival to  keep people from dwelling on unfortunate memories. The catholic church banned Machiavelli work for 200 years because of the force with which he had argued that being a good christian was was incompatible with being a good leader. but even for atheist and those of us not politicians, Machiavelli's insights are important he writes that we can't be good at (or for) all things Not only because of our limited ability and resources but also because of conflicts within moral codes. some of the fields we choose; if not politics then perhaps business or, family life may require what we evasively called 'difficult decisions'. By which we really mean 'ethical trade-offs'. we may have to sacrifice neo-christian visions of kindness for the sake of practical effectiveness. We may have to lie in order to keep or relationship afloat. We may have to ignore the feeling of certain employees to keep a business going. And that, insists Machiavelli, is the price of dealing with the world as it is, and not as we feel it should be. The world has continued to love and hate Machiavelli in equal measure for insisting on focusing our attention on the uncomfortable tension between two things we love and always want to have together but perhaps can't - effectiveness and kindness. And Niceness."

    "Title": "SOCIOLOGY - Émile Durkheim",
    "Transcript": "Émile Durkheim is the philosopher who can best help us to understand why capitalism makes us richer and yet frequently more miserable. He was born in 1858 in the little french town of Épinale near the German border. Before he was forty, Durkheim was appointed to a powerful and prestigious position: as a professor at the Sorbonne in Paris. Durkheim lived through the immense, rapid transformation of France. From a largely traditional agricultural society... ...to an urban industrial economy. He could see that his country was getting richer; that capitalism was extraordinarily productive and, in certain ways, that it was also liberating. But what particularly struck him and became the focus of his entire scholarly career, was that the economic system was doing something very peculiar to people's minds. It was, quite literally, driving them to suicide. In ever increasing numbers. This was the immense insight unveiled in Durkheim's most important work: Suicide, published in 1897. The book chronicled the remarkable and tragic discovery that suicide rates seem to shoot up once a nation has become industrialized and consumer capitalism takes hold. Durhkheim observed that the suicide rate of Britain of his day was double that of Italy but in even richer and more advanced Denmark it was four times higher than in the UK. Durkheim's focus on suicide was intended to shed light on a more general level  of unhappiness and dispair in society. Suicide was the horrific tip of the iceberg of mental distress created by modern capitalism. Across his career, Durkheim tried to explain why people had become so unhappy in modern societies, and he isolated five crucial factors: 1-In traditional societies, people's identities are closely tied to belonging to a clan or a class. Few choices are involved; a person might be a baker, a lutheran or married to their second cousin without ever having made any self-conscious decisions for themselves. They can just step into a place created for them by their family and the existing fabric of society. But under modern capitalism, it's the individual that now begins to choose everything: what job to take, what religion to follow, who to marry and where to belong. If things go well, the individual takes all the credit. But if things go badly, the individual is in crueler place than ever before for it seemingly means that there is no one else to blame but they themselves. Failure becomes a terrible judgement upon the individual. This is the particular burden of life in modern capitalism. Capitalism raises hopes: everyone, with effort, can become the boss. Advertising stokes ambition, by showing us limitless luxury that we could, if we play our cards right, secure very soon. The opportunities are said to be enormous, but so too are the possibilities for disappointment. In modern capitalism, envy grows rife. It is easy to become deeply dissatisfied with one's lot, not because it's objectively awful, but because of tormenting thoughts about all that is almost, but not quite, within reach. The cheery, boosterish side of capitalism attracted Durkheim's particular annoyance. In his view, modern society struggled to admit life just is, often, quite painful and sad. Our tendencies to grief and sorrow are made to look like signs of failure rather than, as should be the case, a fair response to the arduous facts of human condition. One of the complaints against traditional societies, strongly voiced in Romantic literature, is that people need more freedom. Rebellious types used to complain that there were far too many social norms. Norms telling you what to wear, what you're supposed to do on Sunday afternoons, what parts of an arm is respectable for women to reveal. Capitalism, following the earlier efforts of Romantic rebels, has relentlessly undermined social norms. Countries have become more complex, more anonymous and more diverse. People don't have so much in common with one another anymore, the collective answers to even very important questions like who should you marry or how should you bring up your children have become weaker and less specific. There's a lot of reliance on the phrase 'Whatever works for you', which sounds friendly, but it also means that society doesn't much care what you do and doesn't feel confident that it has good answers to the big questions of your life. In upbeat moments, we like to think of ourselves as fully up to the task of reinventing life and working everything out for ourselves. But in reality, as Durkheim knew, we're often simply too tired, too busy, too uncertain and then there's nowhere to turn. Durkheim was himself an atheist, but he worried that religion has become implausible just as its best side, its communal side, would've been most useful to repair the fraying social fabric. Despite its factual errors in its fantastical dimensions, Durkheim appreciated religion. He knew that the sense of community and consolation that religion offer are highly important to people. Capitalism has, as yet, offered nothing to replace this with. Science certainly doesn't offer the same opportunities for powerful shared experiences. The periodic table might well possess a transcendent beauty and be a marvel of intellectual elegance, but it can't draw a society together around it. In the nineteenth century, it had looked at certain moments, as if the idea of the nation might grow so powerful and intense that it could take up the sense of belonging and shared devotion that had once been supplied by religion. Admittedly, there were some heroic moments, but they generally didn't work out very well. Family too seemed for a time to offer the experience of belonging that people seem to need. But today, although we do indeed invest hugely in our families, they're not as stable as we might hope and by adulthood children are hardly tied to their parents anymore. They don't expect to work alongside them, they don't expect their social circles to overlap and they don't feel and they don't feel that their parent's honour is in their hands. Today, neither family nor the nation are well placed to take up the task of giving us a larger sense of belonging, of giving us the feeling we're part of something more valuable than ourselves. Émile Durkheim was a master diagnostician of our ills. He shows us that modern economies put tremendous pressures on individuals and leave them dangerously bereft of authoritative guidance and communal solace. We are all Durkheim's heirs and still have ahead of us the task that he grappled with. How we can create new ways of belonging, how we can take some of the pressure off individuals and find a more correct balance between freedom and solidarity and how to generate ideologies that will allow us not to be so tough on ourselves for our failures and our setbacks."

    "Transcript": "Everyone agrees that education is hugely important The thing is we're not particularly sure what we want from it The aim of education should be to prepare us for the challenges of adult life Yet from this perspective it's clear that schools fail all but for tiny portions of their students Whether in highly academic private schools Or in deprived government-run ones trouble-dealing with life's challenges remains very wide spread indeed Human ingenuity, energy, goodwill, and talent is being lost on an industrial scale to get more ambitious about education doesn't necessarily mean spending more money building more schools, employing more teachers or making exams more difficult Rather, it should mean focusing more on the real purpose of education There are two fundamental tasks it should help us with: working and sustaining good relationships In order to address these needs a future national curriculum might specify that the following subjects be studied Firstly, capitalism A conspiracy of silence exists around the economic system we live within We find it hard to change its bad sides or defend its strengths because we simply don't fully understand how it works A subject like maths should be geared to teach its number one utility for 99% of the population dealing with money Such classes would demistify the global economy by teaching students the importance of the means of production and how profits are made The role of cashflow, HR leadership, marketing, and competition would also be studied In a perfect school system you'd also then study a really big second subject yourself Young students would be introduced to the idea that we humans are extremely prone to misunderstanding ourselves They would be taken through the concepts of delusion, defensiveness projection and denial in everyday life Individual tutors would be on hand to help students towards personality maps with particular attention paid to their neurosis and fears Doing this would ensure that students learn a lot about how complex they truly are and what types of people they would be best suited to hang out with A crucial unit would be devoted to career self-knowledge What job are you best suited to? Students would spend three hours a week exploring what they might do with their futures Then we would sutdy relationships Being intensely aware of the social and individual cost of every unhappy relationship An ideal education system would emphasize the acquisition of skills that help people to live better together There would be units on kindness and forgiveness as well as on anxiety-reduction techniques In this educational utopia it wouln't only be children who would go to school but adults as well Schooling would be for life Education wouldn't just be taking place in classrooms media and the arts would be made to maximize their teaching potential and help to teach people what they actually need to learn We're so hung up on the challenges of running a massive education system we're failing to pinpoint the real source of its problems These are primarily about money, salaries or discipline These are only a consequence of a more fundamental problem Right now and with no-one quite meaning for this to happen we've simply got the wrong curriculum"

    "Title": "Higher Consciousness",
    "Transcript": "The term \"higher consciousness\" is often used by spiritually minded people to describe important but hard to reach mental states. Hindu sages, Christian monks, and Buddhist ascetics all speak of reaching moments of  higher consciousness through meditation, or chanting, fasting, or pilgrimages. Unfortunately the way in which these spiritual people discuss their states of higher consciousness has a tendency to put a lot of secular types on edge. It can all sound maddeningly vague, wishy-washy, touchy-feely, and for want of a better word, annoying. What on Earth do these gurus really mean? We deeply sympathize with such frustrations, not being by nature particularly attracted to the ineffable or the mysterious, however it seems that the idea of higher consciousness is in fact a very interesting one which has nothing inherently to do with spirituality and can be defined simply enough in strictly rational and secular terms. This is how we see it: as human beings we spend most of our lives functioning in states of lower consciouness where what we're principally concerned with is ourselves, our survival, and our own success narrowly defined. Ordinary life rewards practical unintrospective self-justifying outlooks, sort of the hallmarks of lower consciousness. Neuroscientists speak of a lower part of the brain they call \"The Reptilian Mind\" and tell us that under its sway we strike back when we're hit, blame others, quell any stray questions that lack immediate relevance, fail to free associate and stick closely to a flattering image of who we are and where we're headed. However, rare moments when there are no threats of demands upon us, perhaps late at night or early in the morning when our bodies and passions are comfortable and quiescent, we have the privilege of being able to access the higher mind, what neuroscientists call our neocortex, the seat of imagination, empathy, and impartial judgement. We loosen our hold on our own egos and ascend to a less biased and more universal perspective casting off a little of the customary anxious self-justification and brutal pride. In such states the mind moves beyond its particular self interests and cravings. We start to think of other people in a more imaginative way rather than criticize and attack, we're free to imagine their behavior being driven by pressures derived from their own primitive minds which they're generally in no position to tell us about. Their temper or viciousness are, we now see, symptoms of hurt rather than of evil. It's an astonishing gradual evolution to develop the ability to explain others actions by their distress rather than simply in terms of how it affects us. We perceive that the appropriate response to humanity is not fear, cynicism, or aggression, but always, when we can manage it: Love. At such moments the world reveals itself as quite different: a place of suffering and misguided effort Full of people striving to be heard and lashing out against others but also a place of tenderness and longing, beauty and touching vulnerability. A fitting response is universal sympathy and kindness. One's own life feels less precious. One can contemplate being no longer present with tranquility. One's interests are put aside and one may imaginatively fuse with transient or natural things: trees, the wind, a moth, clouds, or waves breaking on the shore. From this point of view status is nothing, possessions don't matter, grievances lose their urgency. If certain people could encounter us at this point they might be amazed at our transformation and in our newfound generosity and empathy. States of higher consciousness are, of course, desperately short lived. We shouldn't, in any case, aspire to make them permanent, because they don't sit so well with the many important, practical tasks we all need to attend to. But we should make he most of them when they do arise and harvest their insights for when we require them most. Higher consciousness is a huge triumph over the primitive mind which cannot envisage any such possibilities. Ideally, we'd be a little more alive to the advantages of this higher mind and strive to make our oceanic experiences somewhat less random, and less clothed in unnecessary mystery."

    "Title": "Who are you to say that?",
    "Transcript": "Nowadays, anyone putting forward a valued judgment - that is, anything other than a rock solid scientific fact, is likely to come across the following complaint pretty soon after: \"Who are you to say that?\" You might hear it if, for example, you try to argue that Shakespeare is probably a lot more interesting as a writer than the guy who wrote prose on the back of the cereal packet. Or if you say that Louis Kahn Salk Institute is for sure better looking than an average Holiday Inn. Or that Bach's Mass in B Minor is more technically accomplished than Abba's Super Trouper. Or that The Economist is a better news source than the Daily Mirror. Quite early on in the discussion, anyone who doesn't agree is simply likely to shut things down by saying that no progress on these questions can ever be made, that no one knows how to settle such disputes, and that, therefore, anything goes and any further attempt to pursuade is just bullying or those electrifying and awkward words \"elitist\" and \"snobbish.\" And if you're not careful, there might also quite quickly be a Twitter deluge coming your way. To understand why such responses are so common, we have to look back at history and some pretty unfortunate developments which have led to a collective trauma from which we're still suffering. For most of the history of humanity, we're intimidated by some pretty dodgy purveyors of half-baked valued judgments. Religions used to sell us all sorts of nonsense under the notion that God told us it was so. Kings and dictators would justify their abuses by spurious notions of their inherent right to authority. And members of elite groups, like doctors and academics or just wealthy people, would justify all manner of odd practices on the basis of their authority and fancy uniforms. As societies have gradually become more democratic, and people have learned to stand tall in the face of authority, So too that patience for valued judgments has collapsed. So much so that now anyone who lays forth an idea with any kind of confidence or simply says anything about this or that being good or bad, can swiftly re-evoke the worst of the traumatic old days and will therefore stand to be shut down at once. The only exception to this is science. Here, respect remains paramount. We'll accept an idea if it's a scientific truth. If it's come from a lab result, we'll take it on trust. But anything else when we're in the area of relativity and, who are you to say that is? Now, unfortunately, this is really problematic, as there are some very important questions out there that lie utterly outside the realm of science and can't ever be settled with a formula or experiment. For example, you're always going to struggle to mount a scientific argument when trying to make progress with these sorts of questions: What should children learn at school? What's a good relationship? How should we build nice cities? What's an attractive building? What should businesses concentrate on? How should bosses behave towards workers? Unfortunately, these are essential questions to try to reach intelligent conclusions on. And yet, because by their very nature, these questions admit to doubt and disagreement, it can seem as if nothing solid can ever be said around them. But here's our line: That a question can't be answered definitively, with 100% accuracy, shouldn't be a reason not to try and address it. There IS such a thing as a good and a bad argument outside of science. One can speak better and worse answers to big questions. No one's talking about trying to impose conclusions on anyone else in the way that the Pope or the emperor used to do. It's all about trying to make sound arguments, proceed logically, and attempt to persuade others of your cause through reason and a bit of charm. Rational, democratic discourse depends on people engaging with one another, trying to figure out ideas and not running away from complex issues by dogmatically shutting everything down with the insidious and slipperty retort, \"who are you to say that?\""

    "Transcript": "The Differences Between Us I go through life thinking that there's a right way to do things and a wrong way to do things, and, uh, there's isn't a whole lot of room for subjectivity from my perspective. I've always been...kind of a person that...there is a gray area, and that like if things aren't black or white, that's okay. Zack and I are, right now, in different places as far as intimacy; we want intimacy at different times, uh, you know, at different, sort of, intensities of intimacy, um, and everything from cuddling to sex. I like getting up, like, super early, and I have the most energy when I wake up, and I'm like, the most intimate feeling, for lack of better words in the morning, um, so, and that's hard 'cause John doesn't want to get up until God knows when, um, so then if I try to wake him up, it's just going to be a bad situation, and, on vice versa it's the same thing, like John is, uh, feels very intimate at night and I want to sleep at night and get a good rest so I can get up at six o'clock, you know, as i do. I'm like a volcano, I erupt. And when I erupt, I...want to immediately deal with the situation, and Tim is...the ostrich, with his head in the sand... I worry that my pace...will... start to affect the way Kate sees me, that if my productivity doesn't start to, at least, catch up to her's, that...the weight that she feels dragging behind her, that is me, will start to, uh, take it's toll on her. I feel like sometimes it's this unnecessary weight being put on the relationship; she's part way through talking to me about something and sort of realizes that she's projecting or transposing stresses in her professional life, or in another relationship, and wants to fix it by somehow fixing us, or fixing something that's not really a problem. The last little while we've been in a bit of a dynamic, where Cary tends to be the one who gets to say, \"I want to blow off work today and go do something crazy fun!\", and I feel like I'm in the position of saying, \"No\". But it's like if we can identify something here and talk it through and fix it, I know the relation-like, that somehow everything is going to be okay if the relationship's okay. And...that might be true to a certain degree, but sometimes that's not actually about the relationship, and we're making things about the relationship...that aren't. It's really easy with someone else to fall into patterns of behavior, but if you don't reflect on them and negotiate about them..., I think that they can become stultifying, and I think that you can find yourself being someone that you're not happy being, or exhibiting behaviors that you're not really interested in exhibiting, but that's just the vibe you're in. Chris had come out of a serious relationship, where someone had been unfaithful to him. Not long after Chris and I, uh...got into a relationship, so I knew this would be something that would emerge. What bothers me about Leah is her aversion to conflict... um...I find that when we're in a situation where conflict might arise, rather than going into that situation, she'll try to find a way to navigate around it. It has come up in situations where I'm hanging out with, uh, a male friend that, um, I had had a history with, um, but, uh, I hadn't gotten in touch with Chris and obviously he had, uh, he'd...had very strong feelings, so not just some feelings of jealousy, but uh, really strong reactions- you know, \"are we going to break up? Is this something...\" you know, \"What went wrong?\" Um, and then the result of that is: by avoiding conflict I'm-we're driving right into another conflict, which is the aversion. Lid is more of a free spirit than I am, and my natural inclination when-when it comes to planning a trip or even, ah....going to an appointment or something like that is always to organize it in my mind. Well I suspect from Ross it age, where he thinks...much more negative thoughts than I do. Um...I think it's quite a sore point, actually. And...and at eighty-five I doubt that it's going to be resolved."

    "Title": "POLITICAL THEORY - Henry David Thoreau",
    "Transcript": "most of the time successful modern life involves lots of technology, constantly being connected with other people, working very hard for as much money as possible and doing what we're told. So it may come as a surprise that some of the best advice about modern life comes from an unemployed writer who lived alone in the woods and refused to pay his taxes. Henry David Thoreau reminds us about the importance of simplicity, authenticity and downright disobedience. He was born in 1817 in concord, an unassuming town west of Boston. His father was a pencil maker and his mother took in boarders. He attended Harvard College in 1833, yet he rejected the ordinary career parts like law or medicine or the church. Then Thoreau struck up a remarkable friendship with the American transcendentalist philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson. Transcendentalism is a philosophy that emphasizes the importance of the spiritual over the material when it comes to leading a fulfilling life. Emerson and his transcendentalism had a huge influence on Thoreau. Moreover, Emerson help Thoreau find a place where he could focus on his writing. The older man owned a plot of land in the woods surrounding the nearby Walden Pond. And in 1845 he allowed Thoreau to build a small cabin there, three by four and a half meters. In his two years in the cabin Thoreau penned the first draft of his most notable work: \"Walden or life in the woods\" which was eventually published in 1854. It would become an inspirational text about self-discovery. Thoreau argued that his escape to Walden Pond was not simply a relaxing retreat to the forest. He settled there to live deep and suck out the marrow of life as he put it. \"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately... ...to front only the essential facts of life... ...and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die,... ... discover that I had not lived.\". After some time in the cabin, Thoreau discovered a different more conscious lifestyle. To begin with, he concluded that we actually need very few things. He suggested that we think about our belongings in terms of how little we can get by with, rather than how much we can get. He managed to sustain himself on only one day of work a week, he pointed out that walking the distance of a 30-mile train journey took a day, but working to earn the money to pay for the same journey will take more than a day. Like his friend Emerson, Thoreau deeply valued what he called: SELF-RELIANCE He distrusted society and a progress it claimed to have made. \"The civilized man, has built a coach...\" he said, \"...but has lost the use of his feet.\". He felt that economic independence from other people and from the government was crucial and while he understood that we need companionship from time to time, he felt that too often we use others company to fill gaps in our inner life that we're afraid to confront. The task of learning to live alone was for Thoreau not so much about carrying out daily chores as it was about becoming a good companion for oneself. Relying first and foremost on oneself friendship, intimacy and moral guidance. \"INSIST ON YOURSELF... ...NEVER IMITATE!\", he wrote. Most of all one should change one's self before seeking to change the world. Thoreau also viewed technology as an often unnecessary distraction. He saw the practical benefits of new inventions, but he also warned that these innovations couldn't address the real challenges of personal happiness. \"Our inventions are wont to be pretty toys... ...which distract our attention from serious things. We are... ...in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas, but Maine and Texas it may be, have nothing important to communicate.\". Thoreau believed we should instead look to nature which is full of spiritual significance. He thought of animals, forest and waterfalls as inherently valuable but for their beauty and their role in the ecosystem. We can best understand ourselves as a part of nature, we should see ourselves as nature looking into nature, rather than an external force or the master of nature. Most of all nature provides the meaning that money and technology and other people's opinions cannot, by teaching us to be humble and more aware by fostering introspection and self-discovery. This mental state and not money or technology provides real progress. Thoreau optimistically declared: \"Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn the Sun is but a morning star.\". Perhaps the best testament of the value of Thoreau's, individual contemplation and personal authenticity, is that his ideas lead him to powerful political conclusions. Thoreau argued that people are morally obliged to challenge a government that uphold hypocritical or flagrantly unfair laws. So Thoreau turned to what he called: CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. Peacefully resisting immoral laws in protest. In July 1846, he withheld payment of his poll tax duty to avoid paying for the mexican-american war and slavery. \"I ask for, not at once no government, ...but at once a better government.\", he wrote after spending the night in jail. It was not until he was picked up by subsequent reformers that his essay \"Civil disobedience\" became one of the most influential pieces of American political philosophy in history, influencing Gandhi, Martin Luther King and the anti-nazi resistance. Despite his time as a hermit, Thoreau teaches us how to approach a frighteningly vast, highly interconnected and morally troubling modern society. He challenges us to be authentic, not just by avoiding material life and its distractions, but by engaging with the world and withdrawing our support for the government when we believe is acting unjustly. His works endure and remind us of just how important it is to remove the distractions of money, technology and other people's views, in order to live according to our best and truest nature."

    "Title": "ART/ARCHITECTURE - Caspar David Friedrich",
    "Transcript": "One of the unexpectedly important things that art can do for us is teach us how to suffer. It can do so by evoking scenes that are dark melancholy or painful and that normalize and lend dignity to the feelings of suffering that we might otherwise be experiencing in isolation or confusion. They reveal with grandeur and technical skill that grief belongs to the human condition. Caspar David Friedrich a painter of sublime sadness was born in 1774 in Greifswald, an ancient trading town in the far north of Germany on the Baltic coast. It was a beautiful place in a severe northern sort of way. As a child he loved the way the pinnacles spires and towers at the town loomed above the trees in the haze of the very early summer mornings. His father was a modest artisan of few words and little warmth and his beloved mother died when he was only young. When he was 13 he saw his younger brother Johann Christopher fall through the ice of a frozen lake and drown. He grew up shy taciturn and intense. He was trained as a painter from an early age, but there were many years of poverty and hardship before his distinctive style began to emerge. The taste of the era favored sunny classical landscapes. Summer in Italy was the ideal. But Friedrich was drawn to aspects of nature that up to that point people thought of as uninteresting and disagreeable cold, damp mornings, glacial nights by the sea the pale hour before the sun rises, the flooded fields of late spring. Frederich's first mature work, his first big picture where he started to present his own view of life was a shock to his contemporaries. Instead of the conventional angels, weeping saints and soldiers he depicted the crucifixion of Jesus is happening on top of a mountainous crag amidst Teutonic fir trees with the sun's rays striking the clouds behind. Friedrich realized then that nature could express many of the solemn moods that had previously been associated with the literal rendition of the Christian story. With time he dispensed with direct references to Jesus all together. But he retained the atmosphere of tragedy and grief associated with his life and death. He found that tall trees mountains, mists, the rising of the moon, the stillness of water at night, open heathland, and fog could carry many the same messages about pain, love, suffering and redemption as the Christian theologians once found in the Gospels. He remains a painter uniquely suited to those who no longer believe but who remain attracted to the serious emotions that accompany belief. In 1818 when he was 43 Caspar David married 25 year old Christian Caroline Bommer they had two daughters, Emma and Agnes Adelheid and a son Gustav Adolf. And it seems on the whole to have been a pretty good relationship. Caroline appears in many of his pictures although usually alone. Friedrich was drawn to painting people on their own as if what is most important about us only comes to the surface when we are away from the chatter of civilization. He himself only had a handful of friends and rarely left his simply furnished studio. Instead of solitude being something that we need to evade with business, drink, or sexual fantasies Friedrich suggests it is something that brings us into contact with our deepest possibilities. He also believes that harshness of nature could put the sorrow of the human condition into a consoling and redeeming perspective. Humans can be cruel, fate can be remorseless, but contemplating the ineluctable collision of icepacks takes us out of ourselve, beyond the particular envy, wound, or disappointment that is tormenting us reducing our sense of personal persecution. Works like moonrise over the sea make us aware of our insignificance in the vast natural world exciting a sense of the pettiness of man's disasters in comparison with the waves of eternity, leaving us a little readier to bow to the incomprehensible tragedies that every life entails. From here ordinary irritations and worries are neutralized. Rather than try to redress our humiliations by insisting on our wronged importance we can, by the help of a great art work, endeavor to apprehend and appreciate our essential nothingness. Friedrich uses this striking jagged rock formation, a spare stretch of coast, the bright horizon far away clouds and pale sky to induce us into a mood of redemptive sadness. The smaller islands of rock were once just as dramatic and thrusting as the major rock formations just beyond, the long slow passage of time will one day wear them down as well, above the more clouds which catch light on their undersides and pass on in their transient pointless way totally indifferent to all of our concerns. The pitcher does not refer directly to our relationships or to the stresses and tribulations of our day-to-day lives. Its function is to give us access to a state of mind where we are acutely conscious of the largeness of space and time and the insignificance of our situation within the greater scheme. The work is sombre rather than sad, calm but not despairing. In that condition of mind or to put it more romantically state of soul we are left as so often with Friedrich's work better equipped to deal with the intractable intense and particular griefs that lie ahead of us. Like many artists Friedrich was not terribly successful during his own lifetime. He was admired and his work purchased by a small group of serious people and two of the most delightful painters of the era Kersting and Dahl were his friends he died in his mid-60s in 1840 almost forgotten. He did not know that, in the distant future his work would be deeply admired. Not because it cheers us but precisely because it knows how to reframe and express the sadness that is part of all of us."

    "Title": "Loving and Being Loved",
    "Transcript": "Confusingly, we speak of love as one thing, rather than discerning the 2 very different varieties that lie beneath the single word. Being loved, and loving. We can only make a relationship work when we're ready to do the latter and are aware of our unnatural, immature fixation on the former. We start knowing only about being loved. It comes to seem, very wrongly, like the norm. To the child it feels as if the parent is simply spontaneously on hand: to comfort, guide, tame, feed, clear up, and will remain almost always warm and cheerful. Parents don't reveal how often they've bitten their tongue, fought back the tears, and been too tired to take off their clothes after a day of child care. The relationship is almost always entirely non-reciprocal, the parent loves but they don't expect the favor to be returned in any significant way: the parent doesn't get upset when the child doesn't notice the new haircut, asks carefully calibrated questions about how the meeting at work went, or suggests that they go upstairs and take a nap. Parent and child may both love, but each party is on a very different end of the axis, unbeknownst to the child. This is why adulthood, when we first say we \"long for love\", what we predominantly mean is that we want to be loved as we are once loved by a parent. We want a recreation in adulthood of what it felt like to be administered to and indulged. In a secret part of our minds, we picture someone who will understand our needs, bring us what we want, to be immensely patient and sympathetic to us, act selflessly, and make it all better. This is, naturally, a disaster; for any relationship to work we need to move firmly out of the child and into the parental position. We need to become someone who can sometimes subordinate their own demands to the needs of another. To be adults in love, we have to learn, perhaps for the very first time, to do something truly remarkable, for a time at least, to put someone else ahead of us. That's what true, mature love actually is, much to everyone's initial surprise."

You work like this for days, months, years, even decades, and eventually one day... ... your talents will catch up with your taste and you'll have done something in line with your expectations. You might even be a little proud of yourself, and who knows... ... maybe the rest of the world will be a little bit too. So just keep going."

    "Transcript": "Edward Hopper is a painter of gloomy paintings that don't make us feel gloomy. Instead, they help us to recognize the loneliness that so often lies, at the heart of sadness. In his Automat women sits alone drinking a cup of coffee It's dark outside, and judging by her hat and coat, it's cold. The room is large, empty and brightly lit, the decor is functional, and she seems slightly self-conscious, and little a afraid. Perhaps, she's not used to sitting alone in a public space something seems to have gone wrong, and the viewer is invited to invent stories for her of betrayal, or loss She maybe trying not let her handshake, as she takes the coffee cup to her lips, It might be eleven at night, on a dark February night, in North America Automat is a picture of sadness, and yet it is not a sad picture. There can be something enticing, even charming, about anonymous diners. The lack of domesticity, offers a relief, from what can be, the fullest comforts of home. It may be easier to give a way sadness here, than in a cozy living room with wallpapers, and framed photos. Home often appears to have betrayed Hoppers characters. Something has happened there, that forces them out in to the night, and on to the road. The 24 hour diner, the train station waiting room, and the motel, are all sanctuaries for those, who for sound reasons, have failed to find their place, in a normal world of relationships, or community. Hopper's ability to portray solitude, came from his own familiarity with it. He was born in 1882, in a ship builders town, Upper Nyack, New York. He lived a nice, middle class childhood, as a son of a merchant. And, yet inside, Hopper often felt awkward, indeed a bit like an outsider. In one early portrait, we see him gazing, almost distrustfully, at the viewer. Hopper longed to be an artist, and yet his parents insisted, he trained an commercial art, to keep afloat financially. He hated it, and to escape, he took several trips to Paris, under the pretense of studying french art. But in truth, he didn't feel a connection to the salons, he absorbs some of the impressionist, but forgot Picasso's name. He preferred to be outdoors, watching children playing in the Luxembourg gardens, listening to concerts and --. or travelling up and down the Seine, by boat In 1913, when Hopper was 31, he settled in Greenwich Village, in New York, where he would stay for the rest of his life. This is where he discovered how crowded, and yet isolated, life could be in the city. The population of American cities was skyrocketing, and yet, they were inhabited by passing strangers, who were increasingly alienated from one another. Hopper would ride the L-train, and look down at, in his own words, dark glimpses of office interiors, that were so fleeting as to leave fresh and vivid impressions on my mind. In each room, a separate drama was unfolding, an unnoticed oblivious island, in the sea of people. Although Hopper painted a New York for over a decade, his paintings failed to sell, and he often struggled to find inspiration. Then in his early-forties, he met a beautiful social painter, named Josephine. Edward and Josephine took excursions to paint by the sea, they went to the movies, they went to the theatre, and eventually, they got married. Hopper was no longer, so alone. But, of course, as most of us discover in our relationships, Hopper's marriage didn't permanently end his feelings of isolation, and woe. He still felt lonely at times. He and his wife, couldn't quite figure out their sex life, and she often seemed to prefer, the company of her cat. Hopper discovered that even, when somebody loves us very much, There is always some essential part of us, that remains alone. It is, this recognition that makes his paintings so compelling, and indeed, by addressing loneliness, the art can at it's most therapeutic. Consoling us, and reassuring us that --, and sorrow are normal, and that we are neither strange nor shamefull, for experiencing them. Sad and lonely art, allows us as viewers, to witness an echo, of our own grieves and disappointments. And therefor, to feel less personally persecuted, and pursued by them. Hopper's art helps us to notice, the landscapes of loneliness in our own lives. A side effect, of coming into contact with any great artist, is that we come more aware of the things that the painter would had been receptive to. Nowadays we've come to accustomed to what one might call a \"hopperesque\", a quality found, not only in the North American places that Hopper visited, but anywhere in the developed world, where there are motels, and service stations, roadside diners, and airports, bus stations, and all night supermarkets. For example, service stations readily evoke Hopper's famous \"Gas\", painted thirteen years after \"Automat\". In this painting, we see a petrol station on it's own, in the impending darkness. The isolation is made poignant and enticing. The darkness that spreads like fog from the right of the canvas, contrast with the security of the station. Against the backdrop of Night in the Wild Woods, and the last outpost of humanity, a sense of kinship seems easier to develop, than in daylight in the city. Hopper loved the introspective mood that travelling often puts us in to. He liked painting the atmosphere inside half empty train carriages, making their way across the landscape. But we can stand outside our normal selves, and look over our lives in a way that we don't, in more settled circumstances. We have all known the atmosphere inside Hopper's car C No. 293 that perhaps we have not recognized it as well, as when Hopper has held the mirror up to it. After Hopper's marriage, his professional life suddenly improved as well. He felt more creative, it was the era of the great depression, and yet his paintings began to sell. Critics rated, museums bought his work, and he received awards. Yet despite his succes, he remained deeply introverted, and instead of escaping his solitude, he embraced it. For decades, he turned down the awards, rejected the speaking opportunities, and lived simply, out of the public eye. He died in 1967, and yet his art remains, and retains the ability to help us to see, the loneliness in our own lives, from a wiser, and more mature perspective. Oscar Wilde, once remarked that there had been no fog in London, until Whistler painted it. There was of course lots of fog, it was just that it was harder to notice it's qualities, without the example of Whistler, did direct our gaze. What was said of Whistler, we may well say of Hopper. That there were far fewer strangely haunting, and consolingly beautiful service stations, and train carriages, motels and dinets, before Hopper began to paint."
